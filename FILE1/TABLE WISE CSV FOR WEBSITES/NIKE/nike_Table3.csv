Finding its rhythm in hip-hop culture, releasing limited collabs and colourways, Air Force 1 became an iconic sneaker around the globe. And with over 2,000 iterations of this staple, its impact on fashion, music and sneaker culture can't be denied.",

After the 7-year journey from conception to release, the Air VaporMax represents a new era in Nike innovation.

Made for runners, the futuristic technology was quickly adopted by the street, bringing this light-as-air feeling to the masses.",

A springy ride for any run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot.

Air Force 1
Debuting in 1982 as a basketball must-have, the Air Force 1 came into its own in the '90s. The clean look of the classic white-on-white AF-1 was endorsed from the basketball courts to the street and beyond. Finding its rhythm in hip-hop culture, releasing limited collabs and colourways, Air Force 1 became an iconic sneaker around the globe. And with over 2,000 iterations of this staple, its impact on fashion, music and sneaker culture can't be denied.",2.0

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made from our all-new Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam, to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces its carbon footprint in a pair of midsoles by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam.*) We coupled the ReactX foam with Nike Running's best-fitting Flyknit yet, so you can take off any time, anywhere with secure upper support and breathability. It's the kind of shoe that can grant you that priceless peace of mind to go faster and further, thanks to an intuitive design that supports every stride. *The carbon footprint of ReactX is based on a cradle-to-gate assessment reviewed by PRé Sustainability B.V. and Intertek China. Other midsole components such as airbags, plates or other foam formulations were not considered.

What's new about the Nike InfinityRN 4?
This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with the new ReactX foam delivering more support. The revamped Flyknit upper and wider toe box help your foot feel stable and secure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride. A new internal Flyknit fit band (like a rubber band around the middle of your foot) offers elastic, secure support.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Contained breathability
A water-repellent liner in the toe helps keep you dry when the weather turns.

Flyknit tongue is adjustable and plush.

Increased rubber at the outsole gives traction and durability.

Newly implemented ZoomX foam in the midsole takes an already respected, trusted shoe to another performance level that wasn't present in the Zoom Fly 4. The addition makes for a lighter, more responsive cushioning system. Take advantage of these all-purpose traits that help you run faster and more easily, and have more fun on your runs.

Stay in rhythm

A springy ride for every run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot. Suede material allows it to provide better fit without irritation, from your 1st run to your last run.

Designed for the all-day grinders and dawn patrollers, destined for feet of the fanatic that just moseyed back to the driving range after shaving a few strokes off yesterday's score. The Nike Air Zoom Victory Tour 3 offers robust comfort, unreal energy return and brand-new spikes whether you're swinging through or playing through en route to 36. Plus, the old-school look will earn a knowing head nod from your peers after picking your putt out of the cup.

Feel the grip
A new Champs Spike System in the key 3 forefoot spike locations work with Cyclone Pro Tour spikes to offer exceptional traction in all conditions. They give your feet great grip on the ground when you're going all out for the pin.

Soft to the touch
Full-grain leather has a supple feel and sophisticated look. An internal strap stretches over then secures your foot, helping to contour to its shape.

All-round response
We stitched a Zoom Air unit directly to the upper instead of being set into foam, so it responds to every step. A full-length plate beneath the Air unit helps increase energy return. Soft foam under the heel delivers an extremely smooth ride.

More benefits
A moulded 3D collar helps you stay stabilised.
Internal foam pods cushion your heel.

Catch 'em if you can. Giving you race-day speed to conquer any distance, the Nike Vaporfly 3 is made for the chasers, the racers and the elevated pacers who can't turn down the thrill of the pursuit. We reworked the leader of the super shoe pack and tuned the engine underneath to help you chase personal bests from a 10K to marathon. From elite runners to those new to racing, this versatile road-racing workhorse is for those who see speed as a gateway to more miles and more seemingly uncatchable highs.

Propelling You Forwards
A full-length carbon fibre flyplate provides a stiff and propulsive feel.

Speed for Miles
Nike ZoomX, our most responsive foam, just got a little better. Running from heel to toe, it unlocks even more energy return than before, giving you a springy, bouncy feel.

Stable Ride
See how the midsole bulges out by the heel? We designed it that way to help reduce weight on the inside of the foot to give you a more stable ride.

Feel the Breeze
Specifically selected Flyknit yarns and engineered zones in the forefoot bring a new level of performance to the Vaporfly. Ample breathability around the toes combined with soft, yet supportive yarns deliver our most customised upper for the Vaporfly. The result is a softer, cooler design that contours to your foot.

What's New About the Vaporfly 3?
An updated thin outsole rubber uses less material without sacrificing durability, which helps reduce outsole weight and thickness. This allows for extra millimetres of ZoomX foam underfoot and a smoother transition through your stride.

A water-repellent finish helps keep you dry while a cosy fleece-like feel on the inside helps keep your feet warm for nasty-weather runs. Rugged traction and 2 Zoom Air units provide grip and soft cushioning, so you can power through the elements.

Warmth for Your Feet

Dry Design
A water-repellent finish and gusseted tongue work together to help keep your feet dry. Heathered lining in the collar helps keep your ankle warm and dry.

Rain-Ready Traction
The Storm-Tread outsole provides traction in wet weather. It has textures inspired by winter tyres. Micro grooves grab the road, while multi-directional shapes help shed water for direct contact with the tarmac.

Smooth Transition
Nike React technology is a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a smooth, responsive ride. We paired it with 2 Zoom Air units (at the forefoot and heel) for an energised feel at toe-off. The result is a smooth transition from heel to toe.

A springy and soft ride to energise every mile, the Vomero 17 takes you to your running happy place. Its stacked foam provides premium responsiveness to help you kick it up a notch when you're ready for that extra gear. And with across-the-board enhancements that deliver a new level of lightweight comfort and breathability, this shoe's style and plush feel help you look good and feel confident in every stride.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning that you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Packed with our premium ZoomX and Cushlon foams, the Vomero 17 delivers comfort underfoot for a balanced, soft stride. Based on runner feedback, we also removed the forefoot Zoom Air unit in the previous version to simplify the midsole for a more plush feel.

Responsiveness: super-high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. In the Vomero 17, our maximum spring shoe, your foot sits on a stack of ZoomX—Nike Running's lightest and highest energy-returning foam—on the top and soft foam on the bottom, for an energised yet smooth ride.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Vomero 17 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe that helps complement your natural stride.

Fit and Feel
This shoe prides itself on premium comfort that puts you in cruise control for short-to-long miles. Engineered mesh makes for a lighter and more breathable upper compared with previous Vomeros. A plush insole offers comfort upon entry, and a soft collar feels gentle on your heel once it's time to run. The padded tongue and soft, stretchy laces top off an ultra-comfortable overall experience.

What's new about the Vomero 17?
We simplified the build of the 17 by removing the forefoot Zoom Air unit and stacking premium ZoomX foam on top of the midsole to amplify the cushioned comfort. The result is a softer, more responsive ride.

High-abrasion rubber with lugs on the outsole gives you durable traction.

A springy ride for every run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot. Suede material allows it to provide better fit without irritation, from your 1st run to your last run.

Nike Air Max Origins
Revolutionary Air technology first made its way into Nike footwear in 1978. In 1987, the Air Max 1 debuted with visible Air technology in its heel, allowing fans more than just the feel of Air cushioning—suddenly they could see it. Since then, next-generation Air Max shoes have become a hit with athletes and collectors by offering striking colour combinations and reliable, lightweight cushioning.",

With maximum cushioning to support every mile, the Invincible 3 has our highest level of comfort underfoot. Its plush and bouncy ZoomX foam helps you stay stable and fresh. In other words—it's going to feel good all day, whatever you're doing. It has everything you need so you can propel down your preferred path and come back for your next run feeling ready and reinvigorated.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Invincible 3 has high-support technology, with cushion and stability intentionally placed and shaped to protect your foot from the effects of pronation.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. With Nike ZoomX cushioning shaped like a rocker and higher foam heights, this shoe is so soft and bouncy that just by putting it on you'll be excited for your next run. It gives you ultimate cushioning on ground contact and an even softer underfoot feel for your workout and beyond.

Responsiveness: super-high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. Nike ZoomX foam is ultra-responsive and lightweight, giving you bounce and a snappy response with every step.

Fit: secure, breathable, comfortable
An evolved Flyknit upper places zones of breathability where your foot heats up most. It's strong and durable, helping keep your foot secure with every mile.

What's new about the Invincible 3?
A wider midsole adds more stability than our previous iteration. Taller foam stacks than our previous version raise the bar on cushioning and comfort, in a more sleek-looking design. The strong plastic going around the heel is smaller than our previous iteration while still providing a secure, comfortable fit.

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made from our all-new Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam, to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces its carbon footprint in a pair of midsoles by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam.*) We coupled the ReactX foam with Nike Running's best-fitting Flyknit yet, so you can feel confident in every stride with soft upper support and breathability. It's the kind of shoe that supports every step in style. *The carbon footprint of ReactX is based on a cradle-to-gate assessment reviewed by PRé Sustainability B.V. and Intertek China. Other midsole components such as airbags, plates or other foam formulations were not considered.

What's new about the Nike InfinityRN 4?
This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with the new ReactX foam delivering more support. The revamped Flyknit upper and wider toe box help your foot feel stable and secure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride. A new internal Flyknit fit band (like a rubber band around the middle of your foot) offers elastic, secure support.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Contained breathability
A water-repellent liner in the toe helps keep you dry when the weather turns.

Designed for the all-day grinders and dawn patrollers, destined for feet of the fanatic that just moseyed back to the driving range after shaving a few strokes off yesterday's score. The Nike Air Zoom Victory Tour 3 offers robust comfort, unreal energy return and brand-new spikes whether you're swinging through or playing through en route to 36. Plus, the old-school look will earn a knowing head nod from your peers after picking your putt out of the cup.

A new Champs Spike System in the key 3 forefoot spike locations work with Cyclone Pro Tour spikes to offer exceptional traction in all conditions. They give your feet great grip on the ground when you're going all out for the pin.

Soft to the touch
Full-grain leather has a supple feel and sophisticated look. An internal strap stretches over then secures your foot, helping to contour to its shape.

All-round response
We stitched a Zoom Air unit directly to the upper instead of being set into foam, so it responds to every step. A full-length plate beneath the Air unit helps increase energy return. Soft foam under the heel delivers an extremely smooth ride.

From elite runners to those new to racing, this versatile road-racing workhorse is for those who see speed as a gateway to more miles and more seemingly uncatchable highs.

Propelling You Forwards
A full-length carbon fibre flyplate provides a stiff and propulsive feel.

Speed for Miles
Nike ZoomX, our most responsive foam, just got a little better. Running from heel to toe, it unlocks even more energy return than before, giving you a springy, bouncy feel.

Stable Ride
See how the midsole bulges out by the heel? We designed it that way to help reduce weight on the inside of the foot to give you a more stable ride.

Feel the Breeze
Specifically selected Flyknit yarns and engineered zones in the forefoot bring a new level of performance to the Vaporfly. Ample breathability around the toes combined with soft, yet supportive yarns deliver our most customised upper for the Vaporfly. The result is a softer, cooler design that contours to your foot.

What's New About the Vaporfly 3?
An updated thin outsole rubber uses less material without sacrificing durability, which helps reduce outsole weight and thickness. This allows for extra millimetres of ZoomX foam underfoot and a smoother transition through your stride.

A springy and soft ride to energise every mile, the Vomero 17 takes you to your running happy place. Its stacked foam provides premium responsiveness to help you kick it up a notch when you're ready for that extra gear. And with across-the-board enhancements that deliver a new level of lightweight comfort and breathability, this shoe's style and plush feel help you look good and feel confident in every stride.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning that you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Packed with our premium ZoomX and Cushlon foams, the Vomero 17 delivers comfort underfoot for a balanced, soft stride. Based on runner feedback, we also removed the forefoot Zoom Air unit in the previous version to simplify the midsole for a more plush feel.

Responsiveness: super-high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. In the Vomero 17, our maximum spring shoe, your foot sits on a stack of ZoomX—Nike Running's lightest and highest energy-returning foam—on the top and soft foam on the bottom, for an energised yet smooth ride.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Vomero 17 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe that helps complement your natural stride.

Fit and Feel
This shoe prides itself on premium comfort that puts you in cruise control for short-to-long miles. Engineered mesh makes for a lighter and more breathable upper compared with previous Vomeros. A plush insole offers comfort upon entry, and a soft collar feels gentle on your heel once it's time to run. The padded tongue and soft, stretchy laces top off an ultra-comfortable overall experience.

What's new about the Vomero 17?
We simplified the build of the 17 by removing the forefoot Zoom Air unit and stacking premium ZoomX foam on top of the midsole to amplify the cushioned comfort. The result is a softer, more responsive ride.

Since then, next-generation Air Max shoes have become a hit with athletes and collectors by offering striking colour combinations and reliable, lightweight cushioning.",4.1

With stability where you need it and cushion where you want it, the Structure 25 supports you for long miles, short training runs and even a down-and-back before the day ends. It's the stability you seek, loyal from the first tie-up, tried and tested, with a midfoot system that's fully supportive and with more comfortable cushioning than before.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Structure 25 is all about providing stability for every stride. The updated foam midsole works with wider midfoot support and an increased rocker to give you a more stable platform underfoot and smoother transitions from heel to toe.

Cushioning: high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. New-and-improved foam on the midsole provides a soft and comfortable feel as you log your miles. High foam stacks help keep you comfortable. Shaped like a rocker, the foam provides support for the 3 phases of a runner's stride. It offers flexibility when your foot rises off the ground, a smooth ride when your foot is moving forwards and cushioning at ground contact.

Responsiveness: minimum
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. A Zoom Air unit in the forefoot offers responsive cushioning. Every step helps create energy return to help drive you forwards with a springy, responsive sensation.

Accommodating fit
The accommodating forefoot allows you plenty of space to spread out your toes. The wider forefoot complements a wider base and smooth ride. Added structure and containment around the heel provides a more supportive fit.

What's new about the Structure 25?
We added even more foam than our previous Structures, with better support and comfort than its predecessor as well. The new-and-improved foam underfoot helps give you support.

We listened to the feedback you had on the Infinity Tour, refined it and brought it to life on the Nike Air Zoom Infinity Tour NEXT% Boa. We increased the overall volume to give your foot more room, put an extra-large Zoom Air unit in the forefoot for even more energy transfer through your swing, and we added more traction in key areas to reduce slipping. The result is an incredibly responsive, comfortable shoe that we know you're going to love.

Tuned for Precision
Engineered with high-quality, durable materials and rigorously field-tested, the Boa Fit System has a sleek, micro-adjustable dial instead of laces, so you can create a precise, custom fit in seconds.

Breathable Comfort
Breathable textile helps your foot stay cool. The material hugs and supports you through every step for extra support and comfort. A plush, padded collar helps reduce heel slip while you move.

Dynamic Response
The forefoot Zoom Air units responds to every step. Because it's not fully enclosed, the Air unit can move with your foot, allowing for better energy return when you push off through your swing.

Optimal Grip
2 spikes on the forefoot and 2 on the heel deliver exceptional grip in a variety of conditions. A secondary, integrated traction pattern throughout the sole increases gripping power, so you can play with confidence.

Progress, experimentation and craft. With a modular design and innovative components, the ISPA Universal lets you step into the future of footwear. Inspired by three Nike icons (the Air Max 270, the Zoom Type and the Solarsoft HTM), we harnessed computer-driven data to create a one-of-a-kind look. Every pair is buffed by hand, resulting in a unique artisan finish that differs from shoe to shoe. Breath of fresh air, anyone?

Modular, No-Glue Design
Replaceable components and zero glue means less waste with every pair of shoes.

Future Foam
Bio-EVA foam, used throughout the design, is made from bio-based feedstocks derived from sugarcane. (Translation? We're working to replace petroleum-based ingredients with alternatives as we continue our Move to Zero journey towards zero carbon and zero waste.)

Extra Insole
Each pair comes with two sets of moisture-absorbing, 40% cork insoles—once the first set breaks down, you can simply replace the insole instead of replacing the whole shoe.

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made from our all-new Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam, to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces its carbon footprint in a pair of midsoles by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam.*) This version has GORE-TEX fabric to help you stay dry for your miles. It's the kind of shoe that supports every step in style. *The carbon footprint of ReactX is based on a cradle-to-gate assessment reviewed by PRé Sustainability B.V. and Intertek China. Other midsole components such as airbags, plates or other foam formulations were not considered.

What's new about the Nike InfinityRN 4?
This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with ReactX foam delivering more support. The wider toe box helps your foot feel stable and secure.

Dry Design
Waterproof GORE-TEX fabric helps keep you dry so you can focus on the adventure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Reliable Traction
A Storm Tread outsole provides reliable traction on wet and slippery surfaces. The rubber wraps around the front of the shoe for extra durability. Its generative traction pattern combined with rubber lugs gives you grip when going uphill or downhill.

Our lightest racing shoe, the Nike Streakfly is all about the speed you need to take on the competition in a mile, 5K or 10K race. Low profile with sleek details, it feels like it disappears on your foot to help you better connect with the road on the way to your personal best.

Low and Nimble
A full-length ZoomX midsole provides optimal lightweight responsiveness. The foam stack heights are lower than the Vaporfly, saving weight and giving you a more aggressive feel. It results in a shoe so light it disappears on your foot, while still giving you the responsive cushioning of ZoomX foam, helping you reach your fastest pace throughout the turns and accelerations of any race.

Supportive and Sleek
An ultra-thin knit upper is light in weight while still providing the support you need for racing. Extra reinforcement in the forefoot helps keep you secure. The updated, sleek lacing system is laterally offset with a notched tongue to help relieve pressure on the top of the foot.

Grip Where It Counts
Runner-informed data was used to create the outsole. It uses that information to place traction where you need it the most, with a pattern that connects to the pavement based on how your foot hits the ground. The result is solid grip from foot contact to toe-off, helping you stay ahead of the competition.

A springy and soft ride to energise every mile, the Vomero 17 takes you to your running happy place. Its stacked foam provides premium responsiveness to help you kick it up a notch when you're ready for that extra gear. And with across-the-board enhancements that deliver a new level of lightweight comfort and breathability, this shoe is for those road runners who seek the thrill of the vroom and the kind of plush feel that puts you in cruise control for short-to-long distances.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Packed with our premium ZoomX and Cushlon foams, the Vomero 17 delivers comfort underfoot for a balanced, soft stride. Based on runner feedback, we also removed the forefoot Zoom Air unit in the previous version to simplify the midsole for a more plush feel.

Responsiveness: super-high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. In the Vomero 17, our maximum spring shoe, your foot sits on a stack of ZoomX—Nike Running's lightest and highest energy-returning foam—on the top and soft foam on the bottom for an energised, yet smooth ride.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Vomero 17 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe that helps complement your natural stride.

Fit and Feel
This shoe prides itself on premium comfort that puts you in cruise control for short-to-long miles. The engineered mesh makes for a lighter and more breathable upper compared with previous Vomeros. A plush insole offers comfort upon entry, while a soft collar feels gentle on your heel once it's time to run. The padded tongue and soft, stretchy laces top off an ultra-comfortable overall experience.

What's new about the Vomero 17?
We simplified the build of the 17 by removing the forefoot Zoom Air unit and stacking premium ZoomX foam on top of the midsole to amplify the cushioned comfort. The result is a softer, more responsive ride.

This design is lower to the court, giving you incredible lightweight court feel for bursts of quick movements.

Spring into Action

Nike Air Max Origins
Revolutionary Air technology first made its way into Nike footwear in 1978. In 1987, the Air Max 1 debuted with visible Air technology in its heel, allowing fans more than just the feel of Air cushioning—suddenly they could see it. Since then, next-generation Air Max shoes have become a hit with athletes and collectors by offering striking colour combinations and reliable, lightweight cushioning.",4.5

Waffle-inspired pattern provides traction for the road.
An extra flex groove offers a smooth toe-off."," 
A springy ride for every run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot. Suede material allows it to provide better fit without irritation, from your 1st run to your last run.

Foamy ride
A foam midsole delivers a soft, smooth ride. There's a little more room in the forefoot compared to the 6 as well, so your toes don't feel tight or pinched.

Soft Touch
We added puffs to the heel that are visible on the outside of the shoe. They're soft to the touch and help add comfort to your Achilles. Touch points on the tongue create a natural feel as you take off.

Air Max 97
We realise the origin of the Air Max 97 has become something of an urban myth. (Let's set the story straight: it was a water droplet that inspired the ripple design—not high-speed bullet trains.)

Unlike anything that had come before, it revolutionised the sneaker world with full-length Air cushioning and an innovative hidden lacing system.

Nike Air VaporMax
After the 7-year journey from conception to release, the Air VaporMax represents a new era in Nike innovation. To truly capture the feeling of ""running on air"", the designers restructured the Air unit to be attached directly to the upper. As you step down, each lug gets pushed into the Air unit, ramping up the pressure. Then, as you step off, the pressure releases creating springy bounce with superior flexibility. Made for runners, the futuristic technology was quickly adopted by the street, bringing this light-as-air feeling to the masses.",

Unlike anything that had come before, it revolutionised the sneaker world with full-length Air cushioning and an innovative hidden lacing system.

A springy ride for any run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot.

To truly capture the feeling of ""running on air"", the designers restructured the Air unit to be attached directly to the upper. As you step down, each lug gets pushed into the Air unit, ramping up the pressure. Then, as you step off, the pressure releases creating springy bounce with superior flexibility. Made for runners, the futuristic technology was quickly adopted by the street, bringing this light-as-air feeling to the masses.",

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made with our Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces the carbon footprint of the midsole by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam, so it helps support the planet, too). We coupled the ReactX foam with Nike Running's best-fitting Flyknit yet, so you can take off any time, anywhere with secure upper support and breathability. It's the kind of shoe that can grant you that priceless peace of mind to go faster and further, thanks to an intuitive design that supports every stride.

What's new about the Nike InfinityRN 4?
This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with ReactX foam delivering more support. The revamped Flyknit upper and wider toe box help your foot feel stable and secure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride. An internal Flyknit fit band (like a rubber band around the middle of your foot) offers elastic, secure support.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Contained breathability
A water-repellent liner in the toe helps keep you dry when the weather turns.

Whatever your ""why"" is for working out, the Metcon 9 makes it all worth it. We improved on the 8 with a larger Hyperlift plate and added rubber rope wrap. Intended for lifters, trainers and go-getters, some of the greatest athletes in the world swear by it, and it's still the gold standard that delivers day after day.

Tougher and Stronger
We made the Hyperlift plate in the heel even bigger for stability when tackling tough workouts like Split Squats, Dead Lifts and other lower-body exercises. The plate helps force weight down and out while adding rigidity in the heel. That firmness helps you feel grounded and supported, specifically under heavier loads.

Secure feel
The lace-lock system attaches to the shoe tongue, so you don't have to worry about latching it to any fabric. It helps keep your laces in place, so once you tie up, you can focus solely on your workout.

Go to the Top
We extended the rubber wrap on the side for durability and support so that you can scale any kind of rope climb with the same repeated velocity without worrying about wear and tear. It stretches from the midsole to the upper and adds some support in the upper for multi-directional movements.

Durable and Cool
The lightweight, breathable mesh helps keep your foot cool yet sports the kind of durability that can withstand scrapes, slashes and quick-drag movements.

A balanced ride to help kick-start your run, the Winflo 10 is great whether you're a creature of habit logging your weekly mileage, a rookie hoping to turn intrigue into routine or just joining a friend for a spontaneous weekend run. A neutral support shoe with springy Nike Air, plus more space in the forefoot, leads to a comfortable, bouncy feel. It's ready-made for your run, whenever the road is calling your name.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Winflo 10 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Full-length Nike Air cushioning gives you a soft, comfortable feel for your miles.

Responsiveness: Medium
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. Soft foam in the midsole works with the Nike Air cushioning to give you a bouncy, springy feel.

What's New About the Winflo 10?
A revamped toe box provides a better fit for all foot types compared to the Winflo 9. Plus, we increased the collar comfort and fit, with padding where it counts most.

Whatever your ""why"" is for working out, the Metcon 9 makes it all worth it. We improved on the 8 with a larger Hyperlift plate and added rubber rope wrap. Intended for lifters, trainers and go-getters, some of the greatest athletes in the world swear by it, and it's still the gold standard that delivers day after day.

Tougher and Stronger
We made the Hyperlift plate in the heel even bigger for stability when tackling tough workouts like Split Squats, Dead Lifts and other lower-body exercises. The plate helps force weight down and out while adding rigidity in the heel. That firmness helps you feel grounded and supported, specifically under heavier loads.

Secure feel
The lace-lock system attaches to the shoe tongue, so you don't have to worry about latching it to any fabric. It helps keep your laces in place, so once you tie up, you can focus solely on your workout.

Go to the Top
We extended the rubber wrap on the side for durability and support so that you can scale any kind of rope climb with the same repeated velocity without worrying about wear and tear. It stretches from the midsole to the upper and adds some support in the upper for multi-directional movements.

Durable and Cool
The lightweight, breathable mesh helps keep your foot cool yet sports the kind of durability that can withstand scrapes, slashes and quick-drag movements.

Feel the Foam
A dual-density midsole—firm foam on the outside, soft foam on the inside—provides responsive cushioning for lasting comfort for continuous cardio and movements.

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made with our Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces the carbon footprint of the midsole by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam, so it helps support the planet, too). We coupled the ReactX foam with Nike Running's best-fitting Flyknit yet, so you can take off any time, anywhere with secure upper support and breathability. It's the kind of shoe that can grant you that priceless peace of mind to go faster and further, thanks to an intuitive design that supports every stride.

What's new about the Nike InfinityRN 4?
This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with ReactX foam delivering more support. The revamped Flyknit upper and wider toe box help your foot feel stable and secure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride. An internal Flyknit fit band (like a rubber band around the middle of your foot) offers elastic, secure support.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Contained breathability
A water-repellent liner in the toe helps keep you dry when the weather turns.

Whatever your ""why"" is for working out, the Metcon 9 makes it all worth it. We improved on the 8 with a larger Hyperlift plate and added rubber rope wrap. Intended for lifters, trainers and go-getters, some of the greatest athletes in the world swear by it, and it's still the gold standard that delivers day after day.

Tougher and Stronger
We made the Hyperlift plate in the heel even bigger for stability when tackling tough workouts like Split Squats, Dead Lifts and other lower-body exercises. The plate helps force weight down and out while adding rigidity in the heel. That firmness helps you feel grounded and supported, specifically under heavier loads.

Secure feel
The lace-lock system attaches to the shoe tongue, so you don't have to worry about latching it to any fabric. It helps keep your laces in place, so once you tie up, you can focus solely on your workout.

Go to the Top
We extended the rubber wrap on the side for durability and support so that you can scale any kind of rope climb with the same repeated velocity without worrying about wear and tear. It stretches from the midsole to the upper and adds some support in the upper for multi-directional movements.

Durable and Cool
The lightweight, breathable mesh helps keep your foot cool yet sports the kind of durability that can withstand scrapes, slashes and quick-drag movements.

Feel the Foam
A dual-density midsole—firm foam on the outside, soft foam on the inside—provides responsive cushioning for lasting comfort for continuous cardio and movements.

A balanced ride to help kick-start your run, the Winflo 10 is great whether you're a creature of habit logging your weekly mileage, a rookie hoping to turn intrigue into routine or just joining a friend for a spontaneous weekend run. A neutral support shoe with springy Nike Air, plus more space in the forefoot, leads to a comfortable, bouncy feel. It's ready-made for your run, whenever the road is calling your name.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Winflo 10 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Full-length Nike Air cushioning gives you a soft, comfortable feel for your miles.

Responsiveness: Medium
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. Soft foam in the midsole works with the Nike Air cushioning to give you a bouncy, springy feel.

What's New About the Winflo 10?
A revamped toe box provides a better fit for all foot types compared to the Winflo 9. Plus, we increased the collar comfort and fit, with padding where it counts most.

Nike Air Max Origins
Revolutionary Air technology first made its way into Nike footwear in 1978. In 1987, the Air Max 1 debuted with visible Air technology in its heel, allowing fans more than just the feel of Air cushioning—suddenly they could see it. Since then, next-generation Air Max shoes have become a hit with athletes and collectors by offering striking colour combinations and reliable, lightweight cushioning.",4.7

The Nike MC Trainer 2 can help you shift from circuit training in the weight room to the Astroturf for quick-twitch conditioning, seamlessly. It's a multi-purpose power that combines versatility, stability and longevity to help you stay locked in on the physical task at hand. From back squats to sprint repeats, it can help support the rigours of your diverse training programme without having to make a pit stop to grab more gear for your workout.

Stable Strength
The flat base is wider around the heel to help stabilise your foot while you work with weights. Overlays around the toe and laces add durability to stand up to the rigours of the gym.

Move It from Side to Side
Support wraps from the heel up to the sides for a snug fit when you tighten the laces. Soft foam provides supportive cushioning and rises at the sides to help brace your foot during lateral moves.

Thick and Thin Traction
Rubber tread gives you traction from the turf to the training room floor. It's thicker under the heel for stability while you lift, and thinner in the front for flexibility during short runs or speed drills.

With stability where you need it and cushion where you want it, the Structure 25 supports you for long miles, short training runs and even a down-and-back before the day ends. It's the stability you seek, loyal from the first tie-up, tried and tested, with a midfoot system that's fully supportive and with more comfortable cushioning than before.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Structure 25 is all about providing stability for every stride. The updated foam midsole works with wider midfoot support and an increased rocker to give you a more stable platform underfoot and smoother transitions from heel to toe.

Cushioning: high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. New-and-improved foam on the midsole provides a soft and comfortable feel as you log your miles. High foam stacks help keep you comfortable. Shaped like a rocker, the foam provides support for the 3 phases of a runner's stride. It offers flexibility when your foot rises off the ground, a smooth ride when your foot is moving forwards and cushioning at ground contact.

Responsiveness: minimum
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. A Zoom Air unit in the forefoot offers responsive cushioning. Every step helps create energy return to help drive you forwards with a springy, responsive sensation.

Accommodating fit
The accommodating forefoot allows you plenty of space to spread out your toes. The wider forefoot complements a wider base and smooth ride. Added structure and containment around the heel provides a more supportive fit.

What's new about the Structure 25?
We added even more foam than our previous Structures, with better support and comfort than its predecessor as well. The new-and-improved foam underfoot helps give you support.

Bounce to the Beat

The additional foam not only adds more bounce, but also helps improve transition from heel to forefoot.

Full-length ZoomX foam offers an ultra-lightweight and responsive ride. It's built for speed but also provides cushioning to stay fresh even in the late miles of a marathon. It offers comfort where you need it.

Keep Rolling

With stability where you need it and cushion where you want it, the Structure 25 supports you for long miles, short training runs and even a down-and-back before the day ends. It's the stability you seek, loyal from the first tie-up, tried and tested, with a midfoot system that's fully supportive and with more comfortable cushioning than before.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Structure 25 is all about providing stability for every stride. The updated foam midsole works with wider midfoot support and an increased rocker to give you a more stable platform underfoot and smoother transitions from heel to toe.

Cushioning: high
The more cushioning that you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. The foam midsole provides a soft and comfortable feel as you log your miles. High foam stacks help keep you comfortable. Shaped like a rocker, the foam provides support for the 3 phases of a runner's stride.

A Zoom Air unit in the forefoot offers responsive cushioning. Every step helps create energy return to help drive you forwards with a springy, responsive sensation.

Accommodating fit
The accommodating forefoot allows you plenty of space to spread out your toes. The wider forefoot complements a wider base and smooth ride. Added structure and containment around the heel provides a more supportive fit.

On the 10th anniversary of possibly the most popular Tiger Woods shoe ever, we're re-releasing the iconic design as our 1st true Tiger retro, an ahead-of-its-time game-changer. It offers the unique fit and feel of Nike Free technology for all-round comfort and roaring post-putt fist pumps. The outsole helps keep you steady, so you can channel your Tiger-esque club twirls after ripping a massive tee shot down the middle of the fairway.

Behind the Design
The inspiration behind the Nike TW '13 began with Tiger himself. An avid enthusiast of Nike Free shoes away from the links, he asked for a golf shoe that gave him the same fit and feel as the shoes that he ran, lifted and trained in. The result was a combination of comfort and performance that changed golf shoes as we know them.

Swing Through
The engineered outsole mimics and conforms to the natural motion of the foot, coupled with the traction of a lightweight performance golf shoe. This innovative outsole helps you to keep contact with the ground longer, better harnessing the energy of the foot to the shoe and, therefore, the shoe to the ground.

Fitted Feel
Nike's Dynamic Fit system offers targeted support, delivering strength-to-weight ratio and 1-to-1 fitted support. Flywire-infused nylon straps extend 360 degrees from the footbed to the lacing system, securing the foot for an adaptive fit that provides golfers stability with mobility.

A finely ground, reclaimed foam midsole gives you responsive cushioning for high-impact training. The lightweight, packable design lets you keep them close, no matter where your next workout takes you.

Mindful Design
Made from recycled materials to lessen the impact on our planet, it features a stretchy zonal Flyknit upper construction that is made from recycled fibres and is strategically zoned for added containment during movement. Modified Crater Foam with Nike Grind material was used in the midsole for improved comfort, stability and durability.

Packable. Lightweight. Durable.
Designed with versatility in mind, the lightweight modifications to the upper, midsole and outsole give you a flexible shoe made for more than just your next HIIT class. Equipped to tackle your most challenging plyometrics, yet comfortable enough to wear around town. When it's not on your foot, you'll want to keep this shoe close. The lightweight packability of the new design makes that easy.

Less Shoe, More You
In an effort to minimise waste through an efficient method of construction, Nike designers cored out portions of the midsole, resulting in a lighter feel. The rubber on the outsole is placed in high-wear areas only—achieving an efficient design that gives you everything you need and nothing you don't.

A balanced ride to help kick-start your run, the Winflo 10 is great whether you're a creature of habit logging your weekly mileage, a rookie hoping to turn intrigue into routine or just joining a friend for a spontaneous weekend run. A neutral support shoe with springy Nike Air, plus more space in the forefoot, leads to a comfortable, bouncy feel. It's ready-made for your run, whenever the road is calling your name.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Winflo 10 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Full-length Nike Air cushioning gives you a soft, comfortable feel for your miles.

Responsiveness: Medium
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. Soft foam in the midsole works with the Nike Air cushioning to give you a bouncy, springy feel.

In 1987, the Air Max 1 debuted with visible Air technology in its heel, allowing fans more than just the feel of Air cushioning—suddenly they could see it.

With stability where you need it and cushion where you want it, the Structure 25 supports you for long miles, short training runs and even a down-and-back before the day ends. It's the stability you seek, loyal from the first tie-up, tried and tested, with a midfoot system that's fully supportive and with more comfortable cushioning than before.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Structure 25 is all about providing stability for every stride. The updated foam midsole works with wider midfoot support and an increased rocker to give you a more stable platform underfoot and smoother transitions from heel to toe.

Cushioning: high
The more cushioning that you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. The foam midsole provides a soft and comfortable feel as you log your miles. High foam stacks help keep you comfortable. Shaped like a rocker, the foam provides support for the 3 phases of a runner's stride. It offers flexibility when your foot rises off the ground, a smooth ride when your foot is moving forwards and cushioning at ground contact.

Responsiveness: minimum
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. A Zoom Air unit in the forefoot offers responsive cushioning. Every step helps create energy return to help drive you forwards with a springy, responsive sensation.

Accommodating fit
The accommodating forefoot allows you plenty of space to spread out your toes. The wider forefoot complements a wider base and smooth ride. Added structure and containment around the heel provides a more supportive fit.

What's new about the Structure 25?
We added even more foam than our previous Structures, with better support and comfort than its predecessor as well. The new-and-improved foam underfoot helps give you support.

On the 10th anniversary of possibly the most popular Tiger Woods shoe ever, we're re-releasing the iconic design as our 1st true Tiger retro, an ahead-of-its-time game-changer. It offers the unique fit and feel of Nike Free technology for all-round comfort and roaring post-putt fist pumps. The outsole helps keep you steady, so you can channel your Tiger-esque club twirls after ripping a massive tee shot down the middle of the fairway.

Behind the Design
The inspiration behind the Nike TW '13 began with Tiger himself. An avid enthusiast of Nike Free shoes away from the links, he asked for a golf shoe that gave him the same fit and feel as the shoes that he ran, lifted and trained in. The result was a combination of comfort and performance that changed golf shoes as we know them.

Swing Through
The engineered outsole mimics and conforms to the natural motion of the foot, coupled with the traction of a lightweight performance golf shoe. This innovative outsole helps you to keep contact with the ground longer, better harnessing the energy of the foot to the shoe and, therefore, the shoe to the ground.

Fitted Feel
Nike's Dynamic Fit system offers targeted support, delivering strength-to-weight ratio and 1-to-1 fitted support. Flywire-infused nylon straps extend 360 degrees from the footbed to the lacing system, securing the foot for an adaptive fit that provides golfers stability with mobility.

Nike Air VaporMax
After the 7-year journey from conception to release, the Air VaporMax represents a new era in Nike innovation. To truly capture the feeling of ""running on air"", the designers restructured the Air unit to be attached directly to the upper. As you step down, each lug gets pushed into the Air unit, ramping up the pressure. Then, as you step off, the pressure releases creating springy bounce with superior flexibility. Made for runners, the futuristic technology was quickly adopted by the street, bringing this light-as-air feeling to the masses.",

The Air Max 1 debuted with visible Air technology in its heel, allowing fans more than just the feel of Air cushioning—suddenly they could see it. Since then, next-generation Air Max shoes have become a hit with athletes and collectors by offering striking colour combinations and reliable, lightweight cushioning.",4.6

Nike Air VaporMax
After the 7-year journey from conception to release, the Air VaporMax represents a new era in Nike innovation. To truly capture the feeling of ""running on air"", the designers restructured the Air unit to be attached directly to the upper. As you step down, each lug gets pushed into the Air unit, ramping up the pressure. Then, as you step off, the pressure releases creating springy bounce with superior flexibility. Made for runners, the futuristic technology was quickly adopted by the street, bringing this light-as-air feeling to the masses.",

A special ""Kipchoge-ism"" is on the left insole, while the location and record time of his ground-breaking performance sit on the right insole.

Propelling you forwards
A full-length carbon fibre flyplate provides a stiff and propulsive feel.

Speed for miles
Nike ZoomX, our most responsive foam, just got a little better. Running from heel to toe, it unlocks even more energy return than before, giving you a springy, bouncy feel.

Stable ride
See how the midsole bulges out by the heel? We designed it that way to help reduce weight on the inside of the foot to give you a more stable ride.

Feel the breeze
Specifically selected Flyknit yarns and engineered zones in the forefoot bring a new level of performance to the Vaporfly. Ample breathability around the toes combined with soft, yet supportive yarns deliver our most customised upper for the Vaporfly. The result is a softer, cooler design that contours to your foot.

What's new about the Vaporfly 3?
An updated thin outsole rubber uses less material without sacrificing durability, which helps reduce outsole weight and thickness. This allows for extra millimetres of ZoomX foam underfoot and a smoother transition through your stride.

Rugged traction and 2 Zoom Air units provide grip and soft cushioning, so you can power through the elements.

Warmth for Your Feet
Like a warm jacket for your feet, knit material in the upper helps keep your feet warm. Skins placed around the toes—in areas where water can seep in—help to keep you dry. Insulation on the back of the tongue helps your feet stay warm and comfortable.

Dry Design
A water-repellent finish and gusseted tongue work together to help keep your feet dry. Heathered lining in the collar helps keep your ankle warm and dry.

Rain-Ready Traction
The Storm-tread outsole provides traction in inclement weather. It has textures inspired by winter tyres. Micro grooves grab the road, while multi-directional shapes help shed water for direct contact with the tarmac.

Smooth Transition
Nike React technology is a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a smooth, responsive ride. We paired it with 2 Zoom Air units (at the forefoot and heel) for an energised feel at toe-off. The result is a smooth transition from heel to toe.

A springy and soft ride to energise every mile, the Vomero 17 takes you to your running happy place. Its stacked foam provides premium responsiveness to help you kick it up a notch when you're ready for that extra gear. And with across-the-board enhancements that deliver a new level of lightweight comfort and breathability, this shoe is for those road runners who seek the thrill of the vroom and the kind of plush feel that puts you in cruise control for short-to-long distances. This special design pays homage to the attention-gabbling silent supporters among the crowd, the life-saving pit stops that provide both relief and peace on your path.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning that you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Packed with our premium ZoomX and Cushlon foams, the Vomero 17 delivers comfort underfoot for a balanced, soft stride. Based on runner feedback, we also removed the forefoot Zoom Air unit in the previous version to simplify the midsole for a more plush feel.

Responsiveness: super-high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. In the Vomero 17, our maximum spring shoe, your foot sits on a stack of ZoomX—Nike Running's lightest and highest energy-returning foam—on the top and soft foam on the bottom for an energised, yet smooth ride.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Vomero 17 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe that helps complement your natural stride.

Fit and Feel
This shoe prides itself on premium comfort that puts you in cruise control for short-to-long miles. The engineered mesh makes for a lighter and more breathable upper compared with previous Vomeros. A plush insole offers comfort upon entry, while a soft collar feels gentle on your heel once it's time to run. The padded tongue and soft, stretchy laces top off an ultra-comfortable overall experience.

What's new about the Vomero 17?
We simplified the build of the 17 by removing the forefoot Zoom Air unit and stacking premium ZoomX foam on top of the midsole to amplify the cushioned comfort. The result is a softer, more responsive ride.

The Nike Pegasus Trail 4 GORE-TEX is your running companion for those days when the weather turns. Its waterproof GORE-TEX layer helps keep your feet dry, and less rubber in the outsole creates a smooth transition from road to trail without breaking stride.

Keep the Rain Away
GORE-TEX along the upper helps your feet stay dry from precipitation without sacrificing that comfortable feel of the Peg Trail. Its flexible, lightweight design helps keep out the rain when running between the wet roads and trails.

When the Rubber Hits the Trail
Less rubber along the outsole creates a smooth transition from road to trail while preserving the full-length React midsole. The rubber outsole wraps around the front of the shoe to provide extra durability. A generative traction pattern combined with rubber in the forefoot provides extra grip for technical trails while maintaining a smooth ride for the road.

React in the Weather
Nike React technology is a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a smooth, responsive ride. Its full-length design provides stability as you brave rocky terrain.

Keeping Out the Little Things
Updated materials around the ankle help ensure water and trail debris don't get into the shoe.

Air Max 90
The '90s were a turning point in culture—art, music, fashion and sneakers. The Air Max was at the forefront of the movement.

Bridge the gap between your weekend training run and race day in a durable design that can be deployed not just at the starting line of your favourite race, but in the days and months after your conquest. It offers comfort and reliability but with a propulsive sensation that'll help you feel fast and fresh. That kind of versatility is uncommon in the running arena. But who said you can't have it all?

More bounce
Newly implemented ZoomX foam in the midsole takes an already respected, trusted shoe to another performance level that wasn't present in the Zoom Fly 4. The addition makes for a lighter, more responsive cushioning system. Take advantage of these all-purpose traits that help you run faster and more easily, and have more fun on your runs.

Stability where you need it
Both the forefoot and heel offer slightly wider bases for a stable platform, so you can tackle turns and long runs with confidence.

Stay in rhythm
Carbon-fibre plate delivers a propulsive sensation and a smooth transition at a variety of paces. The plate provides a sort of roll-forwards feel that makes you want to take on the next step.

Whatever your ""why"" is for working out, the Metcon 9 makes it all worth it. We improved on the 8 with a larger Hyperlift plate and added rubber rope wrap. Intended for lifters, trainers and go-getters, some of the greatest athletes in the world swear by it, and it's still the gold standard that delivers day after day. To top it off, we gave this look a multicolour glow that's sure to help your gains steal the spotlight.

Tougher and stronger
We made the Hyperlift plate even bigger for stability when getting through tough workouts like Split Squats, Dead Lifts and other lower-body exercises. The plate helps force weight down and out while adding rigidity in the heel. That firmness helps you feel grounded and supported, specifically under heavier loads.

Secure feel
The lace-lock system attaches to the shoe tongue, so you don't have to worry about latching it to any fabric. It helps keep your laces in place, so once you tie up, you can focus solely on your workout.

Go to the top
We extended the rubber wrap on the side for durability and support so that you can scale any kind of rope climb with the same repeated velocity without worrying about wear and tear. It stretches from the midsole to the upper and adds some support in the upper for multi-directional movements.

Durable and cool
The lightweight, breathable mesh helps keep your feet cool, yet sports the kind of durability that can withstand scrapes, slashes and quick-drag movements.

Feel the foam
A dual-density midsole—firm foam on the outside, soft foam on the inside—provides responsive cushioning for lasting comfort for continuous cardio and movements.

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made from our all-new Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam, to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces its carbon footprint in a pair of midsoles by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam.*) This version has GORE-TEX fabric to help you stay dry for your miles. It's the kind of shoe that supports every step in style. *The carbon footprint of ReactX is based on a cradle-to-gate assessment reviewed by PRé Sustainability B.V. and Intertek China. Other midsole components such as airbags, plates or other foam formulations were not considered.

What's new about the Nike InfinityRN 4?
This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with ReactX foam delivering more support. The wider toe box helps your foot feel stable and secure.

Dry Design
Waterproof GORE-TEX fabric helps keep you dry so you can focus on the adventure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Reliable Traction
A Storm Tread outsole provides reliable traction on wet and slippery surfaces. The rubber wraps around the front of the shoe for extra durability. Its generative traction pattern combined with rubber lugs gives you grip when going uphill or downhill.

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made with our Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces the carbon footprint of the midsole by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam, so it helps support the planet, too). We coupled the ReactX foam with Nike Running's best-fitting Flyknit yet, so you can feel confident in every stride with soft upper support and breathability. It's the kind of shoe that supports every step in style.

What's new about the Nike InfinityRN 4?
This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with ReactX foam delivering more support. The revamped Flyknit upper and wider toe box help your foot feel stable and secure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning that you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride. An internal Flyknit fit band (like a rubber band around the middle of your foot) offers elastic, secure support.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Contained breathability
A water-repellent liner in the toe helps keep you dry when the weather turns.

One of the reasons why MJ loves golf so much: it's like looking into a mirror. The only opponent he sees is staring right back at him. No teammates to play off. No defender to go at. Just him, his swing and the course. This special Jordan Retro 6, with its metallic finishes, chrome aglets and glossy Air Jordan details, takes inspiration from the internal drive that inspires both MJ and us to keep getting better every day.

AJ6 Inspiration
MJ's German sports car served as the inspiration for the original shoe's design, with its very essence conveying speed and class. A moulded heel tab is on the back of the shoe, something Jordan himself required back in '91 so that it wouldn't hit his Achilles tendon when putting it on. Two holes in the tongue nod to the original AJ5.

A springy ride for any run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run. This version celebrates Eliud Kipchoge, who believes there are no limits to his potential—or yours. In a design inspired by his mindset, it has personal touches from Eliud to remind you to keep reaching for more.

Breaking barriers
This unique design celebrates Eliud's record-breaking 5K performance in 2003, when he was wearing the Nike Zoom Miler athletics spikes with the white base and red stripe through the Swoosh logo. A special ""Kipchoge-ism"" is on the left insole, while the location and record time of his ground-breaking performance sit on the right insole.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot.

The heel area optimises the landing space and improves transition and durability.
Waffle-inspired pattern provides traction for the road.
An extra flex groove offers a smooth toe-off.

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made from our all-new Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam, to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces its carbon footprint in a pair of midsoles by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam.*) We coupled the ReactX foam with Nike Running's best-fitting Flyknit yet, so you can take off any time, anywhere with secure upper support and breathability. It's the kind of shoe that can grant you that priceless peace of mind to go faster and further, thanks to an intuitive design that supports every stride. *The carbon footprint of ReactX is based on a cradle-to-gate assessment reviewed by PRé Sustainability B.V. and Intertek China. Other midsole components such as airbags, plates or other foam formulations were not considered.

Behind the design
When you gotta go, you gotta go. We've all been there before. This special design celebrates the attention-grabbing silent supporters in the crowd, the life-saving pit stops that provide both relief and peace on your path.

A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride. A new internal Flyknit fit band (like a rubber band around the middle of your foot) offers elastic, secure support.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run.

Inspired by traditional crafting and a desire to reintroduce the human element into shoe construction, Nike and Jacquemus created the J Force 1. Notes were taken from Nike Considered, the early-2000s project known for using minimal glue as a means to lessen the environmental impact of footwear production. All of this hypothetical influence resulted in a shoe that looks equally at home in an art museum as it does in the outside world.

A springy and soft ride to energise every mile, the Vomero 17 takes you to your running happy place. Its stacked foam provides premium responsiveness to help you kick it up a notch when you're ready for that extra gear. And with across-the-board enhancements that deliver a new level of lightweight comfort and breathability, this shoe is for those road runners who seek the thrill of the vroom and the kind of plush feel that puts you in cruise control for short-to-long distances.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Packed with our premium ZoomX and Cushlon foams, the Vomero 17 delivers comfort underfoot for a balanced, soft stride. Based on runner feedback, we also removed the forefoot Zoom Air unit in the previous version to simplify the midsole for a more plush feel.

Responsiveness: super-high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. In the Vomero 17, our maximum spring shoe, your foot sits on a stack of ZoomX—Nike Running's lightest and highest energy-returning foam—on the top and soft foam on the bottom for an energised yet smooth ride.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Vomero 17 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe that helps complement your natural stride.

Fit and Feel
This shoe prides itself on premium comfort that puts you in cruise control for short-to-long miles. The engineered mesh makes for a lighter and more breathable upper compared with previous Vomeros. A plush insole offers comfort upon entry, while a soft collar feels gentle on your heel once it's time to run. The padded tongue and soft, stretchy laces top off an ultra-comfortable overall experience.

What's new about the Vomero 17?
We simplified the build of the 17 by removing the forefoot Zoom Air unit and stacking premium ZoomX foam on top of the midsole to amplify the cushioned comfort. The result is a softer, more responsive ride.

We listened to the feedback you had on the Infinity Tour, refined it and brought it to life on the Nike Air Zoom Infinity Tour NEXT%. We increased the overall volume to give your foot more room, put an extra Zoom Air unit in the forefoot for even more energy transfer through your swing and added more traction in key areas to help reduce slipping. The result is an incredibly responsive, comfortable shoe that we know you're going to love.

Breathable Comfort
Breathable textile helps your foot stay cool. The material hugs and supports you through every step for extra support and comfort. A plush, padded collar helps reduce heel slip while you move.

Dynamic Response
The large forefoot Zoom Air units respond to every step. Because it's not fully enclosed, the Air unit can move with your foot, allowing for better energy return when you push off through your swing.

Optimal Grip
Piston spikes and a data-informed traction pattern give you exceptional grip. The spikes are placed under the Zoom Air units and are designed to compress with pressure for better energy return and added comfort throughout your round.

Whatever your ""why"" is for working out, the Metcon 9 makes it all worth it. We improved on the 8 with a larger Hyperlift plate and added rubber rope wrap. Intended for lifters, trainers and go-getters, some of the greatest athletes in the world swear by it, and it's still the gold standard that delivers day after day. This version has Nike EasyOn technology—the flexible heel collapses when you step in then snaps back into place—to help make them easy to put on and take off.

FlyEase is now EasyOn
As we continue to make more Nike products easier to wear and use for every body, we switched up the name to make it easier to understand.

Tougher and stronger
We made the Hyperlift plate in the heel even bigger for stability when tackling tough workouts like Split Squats, Dead Lifts and other lower-body exercises. The plate helps force weight down and out while adding rigidity in the heel. That firmness helps you feel grounded and supported, specifically under heavier loads.

Secure feel
The lace-lock system attaches to the shoe tongue, so you don't have to worry about latching it to any fabric. It helps keep your laces in place, so once you tie up, you can focus solely on your workout.

Go to the top
We extended the rubber wrap on the side for durability and support so that you can scale any kind of rope climb with the same repeated velocity without worrying about wear and tear. It stretches from the midsole to the upper and adds some support in the upper for multi-directional movements.

Durable and cool
The lightweight, breathable mesh helps keep your foot cool yet sports the kind of durability that can withstand scrapes, slashes and quick-drag movements.

Feel the foam
A dual-density midsole—firm foam on the outside, soft foam on the inside—provides responsive cushioning for lasting comfort for continuous cardio and movements.

Cushioned and Durable
We stitched a full-length Zoom Air unit directly to the upper instead of into foam, so it responds to every step.

Revolutionary Responsiveness
Anatomically designed toe box is reinforced on the inside of the shoe for added durability while sliding. Overlays in key places offer more flexibility and breathability.

Data-driven Traction
We used athlete data to create an exceptionally durable, minimal outsole that delivers optimal grip without adding any extra weight.

Lightweight, breathable mesh helps keep you cool during your toughest matches. A plush, padded collar and partial inner sleeve help keep your heel from slipping while you move.

Trail Speed
For the first time in Nike Trail Running, we implemented a carbon Flyplate, layered between ZoomX foam and a knit fabric-wrapped midsole, to give you propulsive energy and a springy feel. It helps you stay fresh to continue pushing the limits of speed, whether you're at mile 1 or mile 50.

Traction for Various Conditions
Slimmer and lighter than a traditional outsole, the Vibram outsole has a sticky rubber that works with a chevron lug pattern to provide grip on both uphill climbs and downhill descents, even in wet weather.

Stable on the Trail
A flat bottom and minimised cross rocker give you optimal stability on trail terrain while the heel-to-toe rocker provides a smooth transition. Specifically engineered zones of support in the midfoot give you a secure yet lightweight feel, while weaving through the trail at a rapid pace.

Durability Where You Need It
The fabric wrap on the midsole helps to cushion the foam from the elements and abrasion of being on the trails. Hard-wearing abrasion-resistant materials provide durability.

Stretchy and supportive Flyknit upper creates a design that's seamless, breathable and feels as light as air.

Lightened Up
A slimmed-down design with leaner cushioning means less bulk to help you stay fast on your feet.

More Stability
With your feet closer to the ground, you'll get more support during lateral moves like side lunges and skier jumps. A big arc acts like a brace and pairs with added reinforcements on the heel and sides to secure your foot.

Flexibility on the Floor
A divide under the natural flex of your toes lets your foot bend effortlessly for stability while holding a plank or doing mountain climbers and burpees.

More benefits
Lightweight mesh helps keep your feet cool.
Grid-shaped reinforcements add durability.
Rubber tread in key areas gives you durable traction.

A balanced ride to help kick-start your run, the Winflo 10 is great whether you're a creature of habit logging your weekly mileage, a rookie hoping to turn intrigue into routine or just joining a friend for a spontaneous weekend run. A neutral support shoe with springy Nike Air, plus more space in the forefoot, leads to a comfortable, bouncy feel. It's ready-made for your run, whenever the road is calling your name.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Winflo 10 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Full-length Nike Air cushioning gives you a soft, comfortable feel for your miles.

Responsiveness: Medium
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. Soft foam in the midsole works with the Nike Air cushioning to give you a bouncy, springy feel.

What's New About the Winflo 10?
A revamped toe box provides a better fit for all foot types compared to the Winflo 9. Plus, we increased the collar comfort and fit, with padding where it counts most.

All the Grooves

Air Max 90
The '90s were a turning point in culture—art, music, fashion and sneakers. The Air Max was at the forefront of the movement. With even more exposed Air cushioning and a bold new colour affectionately dubbed as ""Infrared"", its revolutionised design helped the first 90 take on a life of its own. No longer just a running shoe, it solidified Air Max as a streetwear cornerstone.",2.7

Nike Air VaporMax
After the 7-year journey from conception to release, the Air VaporMax represents a new era in Nike innovation. To truly capture the feeling of ""running on air"", the designers restructured the Air unit to be attached directly to the upper. As you step down, each lug gets pushed into the Air unit, ramping up the pressure. Then, as you step off, the pressure releases creating springy bounce with superior flexibility. Made for runners, the futuristic technology was quickly adopted by the street, bringing this light-as-air feeling to the masses.",

With stability where you need it and cushion where you want it, the Structure 25 supports you for long miles, short training runs and even a down-and-back before the day ends. It's the stability you seek, loyal from the first tie-up, tried and tested, with a midfoot system that's fully supportive and with more comfortable cushioning than before.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Structure 25 is all about providing stability for every stride. The updated foam midsole works with wider midfoot support and an increased rocker to give you a more stable platform underfoot and smoother transitions from heel to toe.

Cushioning: high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. The foam midsole provides a soft and comfortable feel as you log your miles. High foam stacks help keep you comfortable. Shaped like a rocker, the foam provides support for the 3 phases of a runner's stride. It offers flexibility when your foot rises off the ground, a smooth ride when your foot is moving forwards and cushioning at ground contact.

Responsiveness: minimum
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. A Zoom Air unit in the forefoot offers responsive cushioning. Every step helps create energy return to help drive you forwards with a springy, responsive sensation.

Accommodating fit
The accommodating forefoot allows you plenty of space to spread out your toes. The wider forefoot complements a wider base and smooth ride. Added structure and containment around the heel provides a more supportive fit.

What's new about the Structure 25?
We added even more foam than our previous Structures, with better support and comfort than its predecessor as well. The new-and-improved foam underfoot helps give you support.

A springy ride for any run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run. This special design is inspired by the portable pit stops that provide relief on race day. When you gotta go, you gotta go. We've all been there before.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure-but-forgiving sensation, like the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot.

Eliud Kipchoge believes there are no limits to his potential—or yours. In a design inspired by his mindset, this version of the Nike Zoom Fly 5 has personal touches from Eliud to remind you to keep reaching for more. Bridge the gap between your weekend training run and race day in this durable design. Wear this neutral road runner for your favourite race and in the days after your conquest. It offers comfort, stability and reliability but with a propulsive sensation that helps you feel fast and fresh. That kind of versatility is uncommon in the running arena. But who said you can't have it all?

Breaking barriers
This unique design celebrates Eliud's record-breaking 5K performance in 2003, when he was wearing the Nike Zoom Miler athletics spikes with the white base and red stripe through the Swoosh logo. A special ""Kipchoge-ism"" is on the left insole, while the location and record time of his ground-breaking performance sit on the right insole.

Newly implemented ZoomX foam in the midsole takes an already respected, trusted shoe to a performance level that wasn't present in the Zoom Fly 4. The addition makes for a lighter, more responsive cushioning system. Take advantage of these all-purpose traits that help you have more fun on your runs.

You've perfected your skill through endless training and channelled your inner fire into your craft. Now, when the weight of the match is squarely on your shoulders, rise to the occasion and deliver. Bold reds and gentle oranges speak to the fearless-yet-grounded attitude needed to embrace these pressure-packed moments. Loaded with a football-specific Zoom Air unit and sticky touch, the Elite boot helps you—and the world's biggest stars—take your game to the next level and put the pedal down in the waning minutes of a match, when it matters most.

Pressure ready
Undulating, undaunted reds and soothing, rolling oranges represent the passion and adrenaline that arise when the game's pressure peaks. Repeating patterns represent the unseen training and endless repetitions that you pour into your game, so that you're ready for the pressure. The blend of technical skill and emotional drive combines for a moment of focus and clarity.

Springy underfoot feel
A 3/4-length Zoom Air unit sits in the plate and provides an extra level of springy underfoot feel that helps you move fast on the pitch and create separation when it matters the most—whether you're scoring goals, being first to the ball or going past defenders.

Improved fit
A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better fit in the heel.

Feel the ball
The upper is made from Vaporposite+, which combines a grippy, grid mesh with a premium material for optimal ball control at high speeds. The material provides a tactile feel across the surface of the upper. It's soft but stable, and wraps tightly around your foot, giving you a more natural on-ball feel when dribbling, passing or scoring.

Dig in, take off
Tri-star studs provide multi-directional traction with every step, so you can change directions quickly and confidently. Heel studs provide traction and stability when braking. Toe-off centre studs give you traction during explosive starts.

Drive your speed
The speed cage inside the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding weight.

Get grounded, stay grounded. The AJ XXXVIII is all about groundwork—we're talking about your running, your cutting, your turn-around jumpers—with low-to-the-court cushioning and a secure upper that helps support every move. It's also designed with sustainability in mind, with at least 20% recycled content by weight. So you can hit 'em with that windscreen-wiper fake and feel good about more than just sinking a bucket for your team.

Court mobility
You want quicker cuts, speedier sprints and all-over court control. The low-to-the-court Zoom Air Strobel unit helps you get there.

Strength + security
The embroidery in the upper is designed to help you feel extra secure while criss-crossing the court. Your skills, plus supportive, lightweight mesh? A winning combo.

Heritage details
Baked right into the shoe's design are shout-outs to MJ's legendary '93 season. Cross-hatches, chevrons and lines of ribbing on one shoe represent his points, assists and rebounds per game. Fabric details on the other nod to the 57-25 season record—and MJ's third consecutive championship.

Waste not, want not
The last thing we need is more waste. A special Move to Zero box gives you the bells and whistles of commemorative packaging without the extra rubbish.

Last-step efficiency

360 degrees of support
A cage wraps around the entire upper for 360-degree connected support. It helps your feet stay securely contained, whichever way you step—or however quickly you stop.

Our all-new championship trail racing shoe melds our best speed components from the running world with what you need to plant your flag first at the finishing line. It offers peak performance, sleek speed and endurance for those who want to summit nature's playground.

Trail Speed
For the first time in Nike Trail Running, we implemented a carbon Flyplate, layered between ZoomX foam and a knit fabric-wrapped midsole, to give you propulsive energy and a springy feel. It helps you stay fresh to continue pushing the limits of speed, whether you're at mile 1 or mile 50.

Traction for Various Conditions
Slimmer and lighter than a traditional outsole, the Vibram outsole has a sticky rubber that works with a chevron lug pattern to provide grip on both uphill climbs and downhill descents, even in wet weather.

Stable on the Trail
A flat bottom and minimised cross rocker give you optimal stability on trail terrain while the heel-to-toe rocker provides a smooth transition. Specifically engineered zones of support in the midfoot give you a secure yet lightweight feel, while weaving through the trail at a rapid pace.

Durability Where You Need It
The fabric wrap on the midsole helps to cushion the foam from the elements and abrasion of being on the trails. Hard-wearing abrasion-resistant materials provide durability.

Your miles are your getaway, the moments of calm from your busy day. Let the Nike Escape Run 2 help you find your serenity with its breathable design and midfoot support. It's soft underfoot, with the traction you need to get around city streets. It's made for your daily runs and beyond—with a plush sensation that keeps you comfortable from workout to hangout.

Stretch and Breathe
Plush, breathable materials throughout the upper have a comfortable feel. The fabric has a little more give than the original Escape Run, giving you a better fit at the toes.

The Right Fit
We made the collar wider to accommodate your ankle. A soft foam lines the area, giving you plush, stable support.

High Stacks, Soft Steps
Soft is key. The midsole uses lightweight Nike React foam for a responsive, durable ride. Higher foam heights give a smooth sensation for comfort with every step.

Supportive Turns
Support through the heel helps keep your foot feeling secure while running over kerbs or turning on city streets.

Run the Town
This shoe is ideal for running in the city. Multi-directional traction helps provide stability for any surprises you may encounter on your route. The tough rubber outsole was built for the rigours of the pavement.

Lace Up and Go
Embroidered elements create a premium construction that's made for your entire day—from work to workouts. Touch points at the collar and the tongue provide a familiar feel as you slide your foot into the shoe.

You've perfected your skill through endless training and channelled your inner fire into your craft. Now, when the weight of the match is squarely on your shoulders, rise to the occasion and deliver. Bold reds and gentle oranges speak to the fearless-yet-grounded attitude needed to embrace these pressure-packed moments. Loaded with a football-specific Zoom Air unit and sticky touch, the Elite boot helps you—and the world's biggest stars—take your game to the next level and put the pedal down in the waning minutes of a match, when it matters most.

Pressure ready
Undulating, undaunted reds and soothing, rolling oranges represent the passion and adrenaline that arise when the game's pressure peaks. Repeating patterns represent the unseen training and endless repetitions that you pour into your game, so that you're ready for the pressure. The blend of technical skill and emotional drive combines for a moment of focus and clarity.

Springy underfoot feel
A 3/4-length Zoom Air unit sits in the plate and provides an extra level of springy underfoot feel that helps you move fast on the pitch and create separation when it matters the most—whether you're scoring goals, being first to the ball or going past defenders.

Improved fit
A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better fit in the heel.

Feel the ball
The upper is made from Vaporposite+, which combines a grippy, grid mesh with a premium material for optimal ball control at high speeds. The material provides a tactile feel across the surface of the upper. It's soft but stable, and wraps tightly around your foot, giving you a more natural on-ball feel when dribbling, passing or scoring.

Dig in, take off
Tri-star studs provide multi-directional traction with every step, so you can change directions quickly and confidently. Heel studs provide traction and stability when braking. Toe-off centre studs give you traction during explosive starts.

Drive your speed
The speed cage inside the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding weight.

Get grounded, stay grounded. The AJ XXXVIII is all about groundwork—we're talking about your running, your cutting, your turn-around jumpers—with low-to-the-court cushioning and a secure upper that helps support every move. It's also designed with sustainability in mind, with at least 20% recycled content by weight. So you can hit 'em with that windscreen-wiper fake and feel good about more than just sinking a bucket for your team.

Court mobility
You want quicker cuts, speedier sprints and all-over court control. The low-to-the-court Zoom Air Strobel unit helps you get there.

Strength + security
The embroidery in the upper is designed to help you feel extra secure while criss-crossing the court. Your skills, plus supportive, lightweight mesh? A winning combo.

Heritage details
Baked right into the shoe's design are shout-outs to MJ's legendary '93 season. Cross-hatches, chevrons and lines of ribbing on one shoe represent his points, assists and rebounds per game. Fabric details on the other nod to the 57-25 season record—and MJ's third consecutive championship.

Waste not, want not
The last thing we need is more waste. A special Move to Zero box gives you the bells and whistles of commemorative packaging without the extra rubbish.

Manifest your mountainous best, when the trail ahead is skiddy and uncertain. Our all-new championship trail racing shoe melds our best speed components from the running world with what you need to plant your flag first at the finishing line. It offers peak performance, sleek speed and endurance for those who want to summit nature's playground.

Trail Speed
For the first time in Nike Trail Running, we implemented a carbon Flyplate, layered between ZoomX foam and a knit fabric-wrapped midsole, to give you propulsive energy and a springy feel. It helps you stay fresh to continue pushing the limits of speed, whether you're at mile 1 or mile 50.

Traction for Various Conditions
Slimmer and lighter than a traditional outsole, the Vibram outsole has a sticky rubber that works with a chevron lug pattern to provide grip on both uphill climbs and downhill descents, even in wet weather.

Stable on the Trail
A flat bottom and minimised cross rocker give you optimal stability on trail terrain while the heel-to-toe rocker provides a smooth transition. Specifically engineered zones of support in the midfoot give you a secure yet lightweight feel, while weaving through the trail at a rapid pace.

Durability Where You Need It
The fabric wrap on the midsole helps to cushion the foam from the elements and abrasion of being on the trails. Hard-wearing abrasion-resistant materials provide durability.

You've perfected your skill through endless training and channelled your inner fire into your craft. Now, when the weight of the match is squarely on your shoulders, rise to the occasion and deliver. Bold reds and gentle oranges speak to the fearless-yet-grounded attitude needed to embrace these pressure-packed moments. Loaded with a football-specific Zoom Air unit and sticky touch, the Elite boot helps you—and the world's biggest stars—take your game to the next level and put the pedal down in the waning minutes of a match, when it matters most.

Pressure ready
Undulating, undaunted reds and soothing, rolling oranges represent the passion and adrenaline that arise when the game's pressure peaks. Repeating patterns represent the unseen training and endless repetitions that you pour into your game, so that you're ready for the pressure. The blend of technical skill and emotional drive combines for a moment of focus and clarity.

Springy underfoot feel
A 3/4-length Zoom Air unit sits in the plate and provides an extra level of springy underfoot feel that helps you move fast on the pitch and create separation when it matters the most—whether you're scoring goals, being first to the ball or going past defenders.

Improved fit
A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better fit in the heel.

Feel the ball
The upper is made from Vaporposite+, which combines a grippy, grid mesh with a premium material for optimal ball control at high speeds. The material provides a tactile feel across the surface of the upper. It's soft but stable, and wraps tightly around your foot, giving you a more natural on-ball feel when dribbling, passing or scoring.

Dig in, take off
Tri-star studs provide multi-directional traction with every step, so you can change directions quickly and confidently. Heel studs provide traction and stability when braking. Toe-off centre studs give you traction during explosive starts.

Drive your speed
The speed cage inside the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding weight.

It's also designed with sustainability in mind, with at least 20% recycled content by weight. So you can hit 'em with that windscreen-wiper fake and feel good about more than just sinking a bucket for your team.

Court mobility
You want quicker cuts, speedier sprints and all-over court control. The low-to-the-court Zoom Air Strobel unit helps you get there.

Strength + security
The embroidery in the upper is designed to help you feel extra secure while criss-crossing the court. Your skills, plus supportive, lightweight mesh? A winning combo.

Heritage details
Baked right into the shoe's design are shout-outs to MJ's legendary '93 season. Cross-hatches, chevrons and lines of ribbing on one shoe represent his points, assists and rebounds per game. Fabric details on the other nod to the 57-25 season record—and MJ's third consecutive championship.

Waste not, want not
The last thing we need is more waste. A special Move to Zero box gives you the bells and whistles of commemorative packaging without the extra rubbish.

360 degrees of support
A cage wraps around the entire upper for 360-degree connected support. It helps your feet stay securely contained, whichever way you step—or however quickly you stop.

Drive your speed
The speed cage inside the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding additional weight for optimal lockdown.

Dig in, take off
Rubber outsole is designed for traction on turf surfaces.

Improved fit
Flyknit wraps your ankle in soft, stretchy fabric for a secure feel. A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better lockdown in the heel.

Barefoot feel
The upper has NikeSkin, a soft and flexible mesh material linked together by a thin coating. It helps provide ball control and truly gives you a feeling of barefoot football.

Nike Air Max Origins
Nike's revolutionary Air Sole unit made its way into Nike footwear in the late '70s. In 1987, the Nike Air Max 1 debuted with visible air in its heel, allowing fans more than just the feel of Air Sole comfort—suddenly they could see it. Since then, next-generation Nike Air Max shoes have become a hit with athletes and collectors by offering striking colour combinations and reliable, lightweight cushioning.",3.6

Manifest your mountainous best, when the trail ahead is skiddy and uncertain. Our all-new championship trail racing shoe melds our best speed components from the running world with what you need to plant your flag first at the finishing line. It offers peak performance, sleek speed and endurance for those who want to summit nature's playground.

Trail Speed
For the first time in Nike Trail Running, we implemented a carbon Flyplate, layered between ZoomX foam and a knit fabric-wrapped midsole, to give you propulsive energy and a springy feel. It helps you stay fresh to continue pushing the limits of speed, whether you're at mile 1 or mile 50.

Traction for Various Conditions
Slimmer and lighter than a traditional outsole, the Vibram outsole has a sticky rubber that works with a chevron lug pattern to provide grip on both uphill climbs and downhill descents, even in wet weather.

Stable on the Trail
A flat bottom and minimised cross rocker give you optimal stability on trail terrain while the heel-to-toe rocker provides a smooth transition. Specifically engineered zones of support in the midfoot give you a secure yet lightweight feel, while weaving through the trail at a rapid pace.

Durability Where You Need It
The fabric wrap on the midsole helps to cushion the foam from the elements and abrasion of being on the trails. Hard-wearing abrasion-resistant materials provide durability.

More benefits
Vaporweave mesh on the upper provides breathability.
Foam midsole adds cushioning.

A springy ride for any run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run. This special design celebrates Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman and an iconic pamphlet he wrote that inspired a running movement.

Behind the design
This Peg 40 celebrates ""The Joggers Manual"", a pamphlet written by Bill Bowerman that gives instructions on how to jog and the benefits that come with it. The colours nod to the book's cover, the stitched-on Swoosh logo harkens back to Bill's days of meticulous tinkering when it comes to training—not straining—and the Swoosh logo material mimics a track's surface texture. Check out Bill's signature on the side and a special message on the inside of the tongue that reminds you all that matters is movement.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot.

The heel area optimises the landing space and improves transition and durability.
Waffle-inspired pattern provides traction for the road.
An extra flex groove offers a smooth toe-off.

Huarache Origins
The Nike Air Huarache released in 1991. Footwear designer Tinker Hatfield wanted to combine the fit of neoprene water-ski boots with the functionality of South American sandals. The instant hit found its way to basketball courts and then the streets, where it earned its status as an icon.",

Throwback Themed
This flashy design, with its iridescent accents and a soundwave-themed graphic that nod to a nostalgic era in music, will help you reset and get in the zone as your favourite anthem powers you to new gains.

Lightweight, Breathable Support
The upper uses translucent mesh for breathable comfort. An inner midfoot strap works with the laces to provide more support as you tighten them.

Energised Steps
We updated the soft foam from the Winflo 8, giving you a springier feel that adds bounce to your stride. We used a full-length Air unit for enhanced cushioning and responsiveness from heel to toe.

A springy ride for every run, the Peg's familiar and just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love, but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot (like your arch and toes). Whether you're logging marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in—day after day, run after run. Cool, calming tones that reflect the natural surroundings speak to a healthy blend of balancing sport and life.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot. Suede material allows it to provide better fit without irritation, from your 1st run to your last run.

Log the hard miles with the Nike Pegasus Turbo. Stretchy high-strength fibres in the upper give you a just-right feel up top. Plus, lightweight and responsive ZoomX foam is designed to help you increase your tempo without sacrificing comfort as you push towards your personal best. Your workhorse with wings is back. It's time to fly.

A More Responsive Ride
Nike ZoomX foam is responsive and lightweight, giving you bounce with every step. Shaped like a rocker, the foam provides support for the 3 phases of a runner's stride. It offers flexibility when your foot rises off the ground, a smooth ride when your foot is moving forwards and cushioning at ground contact.

Lightweight and Supportive
Flyknit technology uses high-strength fibres to create a lightweight upper with targeted areas of support, stretch and breathability.

A springy ride for any run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run. This design celebrates the Pegasus' history with Swoosh logos from the Peg 1, 24, 35 and 38.

Support: Neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: Medium
The more cushioning that you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: High
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting Fit and Feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's New About the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, like the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot. Suede material allows it to provide better fit without irritation, from your 1st run to your last run.

The Vomero 16 adds responsive ZoomX foam cushioning, bringing an energetic pop to your stride that's perfect for high mileage on the road. It's super-lightweight, with plenty of stretch and ventilation through the upper. Looking for the right amount of support? We've got you covered with an adjustable midfoot band and a stable clip at the heel.

We added extra support along the sides via a band at the midfoot. It works with your laces, helping you adjust how snug and secure your foot feels. There's also a clip at the heel, helping with stability as you run across uneven surfaces.

Cool For the Distance
We tested real runners to learn where feet need the most cooling. Using that data, we put mesh in key spots (especially around the toes) to give you stretch and ventilation.

Snappy Steps
Your foot sits on Nike ZoomX, our lightest and highest energy returning foam. It gives you a smooth ride from foot strike through your transition. We combined it with Zoom Air cushioning under the forefoot for a snappy, responsive feel as you push off.

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made from our all-new Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam, to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces its carbon footprint in a pair of midsoles by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam.*) We coupled the ReactX foam with Nike Running's best-fitting Flyknit yet, so you can take off any time, anywhere with secure upper support and breathability. It's the kind of shoe that can grant you that priceless peace of mind to go faster and further, thanks to an intuitive design that supports every stride. *The carbon footprint of ReactX is based on a cradle-to-gate assessment reviewed by PRé Sustainability B.V. and Intertek China. Other midsole components such as airbags, plates or other foam formulations were not considered.

What's new about the Nike InfinityRN 4?
This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with the new ReactX foam delivering more support. The revamped Flyknit upper and wider toe box help your foot feel stable and secure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride. A new internal Flyknit fit band (like a rubber band around the middle of your foot) offers elastic, secure support.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Contained breathability
A water-repellent liner in the toe helps keep you dry when the weather turns.

A springy ride for any run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run. This special watercolour-like print, with floral pastels and subtle pinks and greens, captures the vibe of the summer season.

Support: Neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: Medium
The more cushioning that you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: High
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting Fit and Feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's New About the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, like the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot. Suede material allows it to provide better fit without irritation, from your 1st run to your last run.

Self-portrait with a skate shoe. Transcending every artistic movement is the same elusive goal: to capture one's true essence. The Zoom Blazer Mid x Mason Silva does just that. A staple of the skate scene way before he won Skater of the Year in 2020, Mason's design encapsulates ... well, Mason. From his favourite skate shoe to the simple Orange Label aesthetic he loves, the design shines a light on Mason the skater. He even took pen in hand to draw the chain link branding and self-portrait on the insole. Intimate, complicated and ready to skate—now that's a piece of art.

Sabrina Ionescu's game is unique, hard to define and built with an undeniable craft. Her signature shoe helps you unlock your versatility with a snappy forefoot Zoom Air unit and cloud-like React foam to help keep you energised. We used insights from next-gen athletes around the world to bring grippy, best-in-class traction, reliable midfoot support and stability to the court—which every hooper needs. Built for crafty players like Sabrina but made for anyone who's ready to put in the work to take their game to the next level. With its extra-durable rubber outsole, this version gives you traction for outdoor courts.

Behind the design
Sabrina can be the electrical charge needed to ignite a generation of current and future hoopers on the come up. This special look is infused with voltaic-like sparks of energy and electricity.

Cut Quickly
Athletes around the world informed us on how to build the traction pattern on the outsole. The result? It helps you feel quick in and out of cuts. Feel the hardwood under your feet as you change direction in an instant.

Stay Fresh
We've paired a top-loaded forefoot Air Zoom unit with a full-length React foam core to deliver the ideal balance of stability, ground control and cushioning. The unstoppable combination meets at the intersection of speed and endurance, allowing you to play fast and dictate tempo without feeling depleted as the game rages on.

Play with Confidence
We teamed the collar with a midfoot band system that allows conformability and adjustability around the arch of your foot, all in the name of unlocking quick play and inspiring confidence on the court.

Security Up Top
The collar offers optimal support with minimalism, giving you the support you need, without any unnecessary weight.

Personal Touch

It's ideal for the hoopaholic who can't say no to just one more game. With its extra-durable rubber outsole, this version gives you traction for outdoor courts.

Cushion and comfort
A lightweight Nike Air unit on the bottom of the upper gives KD the cushioning and comfort he needs to thrive during a long season.

High-speed haven
KD loved the 15's underfoot experience, so we took inspiration from the previous iteration and added a bottom-loaded forefoot Zoom Air unit for extra pop and snappiness when the game hits high speeds. Responsive full-length foam adds a soft, comfortable sensation.

Groove and move
Grooves and ridges in the sole help provide multi-directional traction and court feel. A stiff piece under the arch helps keep the shoe stable and help you smoothly transition from heel to toe.

Broken-In Feel
Multi-layer mesh in the upper is lightweight and dimensional with a broken-in feel. Added thickness in strategic areas helps to keep your foot in place by reducing small movements.

Like clockwork
The outsole resembles watch gears, which represent the inner workings of KD and the methodical nature of how he operates.",4.0

When you step on the floor, what kind of performance do you want to put on? Stop the show in these LeBron Witness 8s and let them know there are no limits to your flair and full-scale skills. This sleek and boldly sculpted shoe offers stability when exploding and soft landings when you come back to the ground, allowing kingpins like you and LeBron to bound, brake and bolt from baseline to baseline. With its extra-durable rubber outsole, this version gives you traction for outdoor courts.

Max Air made
A Max Air unit in the low-profile midsole is combined with a foam wrap-up for support when you're moving in lateral directions. It helps cushion your landing while supporting the smooth transition from heel to toe. It also provides side-to-side stability and helps harness and direct your force.

Secure feel
Breathable mesh provides a lightweight, conforming fit in the upper, from the webbing that harnesses your forefoot to the external moulded pieces that help secure your heel. Reinforced stitching along the sides helps the shoe fit snugly for full-foot containment.

Stick and Move
We split the rubber outsole and partially cut it out under the arch to help it bend and flex while helping reduce its overall weight. A classic herringbone pattern adds durable traction.

Giannis's internal engine revs from deep within, requiring a shoe that can harness his superpower abilities. Enter the Freak 5. Stacked with stunning speed for super-quick first steps, stuffed with that sort of springy cushioning that can withstand the all-game grind, his signature shoe lets you feel like the Greek Freak. Blow past your opponent en route to the rim while sticking with quick-twitch ball-handlers when a defensive stand decides the game. With its extra-durable rubber outsole, this version gives you traction for outdoor courts.

Pedal to the Metal
A top-loaded Zoom Air unit in the forefoot provides energy return and responsiveness, putting force into your first step so you can go from the perimeter to the rim with ease.

Stay Contained
For all that force and velocity, Giannis needs a design that stays with him, whatever the defence throws at him. Our internal containment system gives you a more dynamic fit system that limits movement inside the shoe without feeling constricting.

Comfort for 4 Quarters
The springy foam midsole has a responsive underfoot ride. It adds a soft, comfortable sensation to help keep you moving and energised all game long.

In today's game, slow-footed slugs get sought out and exposed. Space makers stay on the floor. The GT Cut 2 EP helps you stop in an instant and accelerate back into the open lane in a low-to-the-ground design that helps minimise court contact while switching direction.

Last time around, LeBron flipped the script on his shoe game as only the King can. The encore is even better. The LeBron XXI has a cabling system that works with Zoom Air cushioning and a light, low-to-the-ground design, giving you agile fluidity and explosiveness without excess weight. Created for your ascent and the next generation of hoopers, it's ideal for Bron-like open-floor attacks and rising towards the rim when the game's pace turns up. This special design celebrates the most valuable pearl in the world, the dragon pearl. With its extra-durable rubber outsole, this version gives you traction for outdoor courts.

Daughter-driven
LeBron is the shield for his daughter, who helped the King grow as a man and softened him as a Dad. He feels the need to protect her always, the same way an oyster shelters a pearl to reach its full potential. Exposed construction on the side of the heel gives a shell-like appearance. The perforated foam tongue is quilted, also imitating a shell's appearance and providing a plush feel.

Luxurious vibes
The patent leather on the upper speaks to the true luxurious nature of the diamond while the vein-like texture in the heel nods to the supportive nature of the pearl.

Cloaked and contained
We reinforced the lightweight mesh with a 360-degree zonal cabling system for optimal containment. We disguised it all with a premium, lightweight drapery for a cloaked finishing touch.

Soften the rise
A Zoom Air unit in the heel and forefoot supports landing and gives you a propulsive feeling. We paired them with a soft, springy foam to help ensure a pillowy feel.

Stay refreshed
Dimensional mesh on the upper is durable and contained. Using lightweight materials, we striated the upper's venting to look like the veining of a shell, helping contain you during explosive movements. Zonal perforations in the sandwich mesh and ventilation on both sides provide breathability.

Your love for the game never fades. That's why the Tatum 1 was created with longevity in mind. Designed to carry you from the first to the fourth (and whatever OT comes up) as efficiently as possible, we stripped it down to the essentials—and made those essentials really, really good. The result is this season's lightest performance basketball shoe, with rubber only where it counts, a stress-tested foam midsole and an uncaged Nike Zoom Air unit for those explosive ups. Whatever stage of ball you're at, the Tatum 1 will keep you playing.

Rubber (Only) Where It Counts
Rubber is heavy, so we did away with as much as possible. But we kept it where it matters most: the forefoot and toe, where you push forwards for big drives.

Reinforced Foam
We wrapped foam around a strong plastic frame in the midsole for lightweight structure. Then, we stress-tested it to make sure it holds up for the full 48.

Minimalist Support
Lightweight mesh in the upper is strong, breathable and helps you feel supported for the whole game (and the next game, and the next …).

Uncaged Air
A Nike Zoom Air unit (visible from the bottom of the shoe) helps get you the ups you're looking for without weighing you down.

It gives you cloud-like cushioning for explosive speed and quick changes of direction, the difference-makers in a game that's becoming more extraterrestrial.

Contained Cushioning

Slovenia—Luka's home country—is the first nation to be declared a ""Green Destination of the World"" in its entirety. Celebrate its status with this special-edition Luka 2. The colourway is inspired by picturesque Lake Bled, a famed example of Slovenia's natural beauty. And the shoe's mindful construction (each pair is made with at least 20% recycled material) honours the country's ongoing dedication to sustainability.

Cushioned for impact
When you're shifting side to side, you need support that's firm—but not rigid. A wedge of cushioning in the midsole butts up against the medial sidewall so you can bank like a champ, and a thick, moulded insole helps you stay grounded.

Last-step efficiency
The other aspect of side-to-side movement? Lateral support. To help your quick stops feel secure, we added a strong, flexible plate that runs up the lateral side wall, complemented by a firm foam carrier and Formula 23 foam in the midsole.

360 degrees of support
A sturdy cage wraps around the entire upper for 360-degree connected support that help your feet stay securely contained, whichever way you step—or however quick you stop.

Whether you're exploding out of triple threat or sprinting from baseline to baseline, it gives you responsiveness directly under your foot.

Minimal so you can move
Built like a modern running shoe, the minimal upper helps keep the shoe as lightweight as possible. The engineered mesh uses reinforced layers to create support around the toe, heel and midfoot, delivering stability without adding weight.

Ankle support
Padded, mid-high collar adds support around the ankle without sacrificing agility.

Foam tongue helps reduce lace pressure.

Ja Morant grew up playing ball on a cement court in his back garden. The rain never stopped him from putting in the work. JA 1 'Wet Cement' honours the games played and drills done regardless of the weather. Like every JA 1, this pair is moulded to optimise hang time while helping to maintain stability with firm cushioning. That on-court control is what helps you respond quickly for verticality. With its extra-durable rubber outsole, this version gives you traction for outdoor courts.

Cemented status
Check out the reflective design Swoosh logo, speckled midsole and marble outsole. Each is an ode to Ja's back-garden concrete court. That's where Ja, his dad and other hoopers from Ja's hometown honed their craft, both back in the day and even now when the rising superstar feels like he needs to get back to his roots.

Personal touch
Ja's signature, personal logo and jersey number are sketched in his own handwriting.

Prepare for lift-off
A forefoot Zoom Air unit helps provide increased responsiveness and vertical acceleration. Plush cushioning in the midsole provides comfort when you come back to Earth after flying in the clouds.

Land softly
A containment system and forefoot strap help keep your ankle and heel stable so that you're in control and supported whether you're changing direction at high speeds, springing towards the rim or staying in front of pro ball-handlers on defence.

Your game is as great as ever, but you're not the type that basks in past glory. Confident, never content. Skilled, but always pushing to be the absolute best player you can be, day in, day out. This special design celebrates the go-getters who dream about snatching a defender's ankles with a nasty pull-back off the bounce, the sneaky backdoor lay-up after a plant along the baseline or a vicious crossover after freezing your opponent with a dirty hesitation dribble. With its extra-durable rubber outsole, this version gives you traction for outdoor courts.

Enhance your 1st step
Nike React technology paired with Zoom Air on the bottom layer of the upper, stacked with a Zoom Air unit in the heel, helps provide the responsiveness you need to create space and opportunity off the dribble. The React insole provides support and comfort. Soft foam midsole offers comfort and a stable underfoot experience.

Quick-twitch take-off
The upper is inspired by a butterfly with an inner cage that's built into the lining underneath. It helps reduce the weight of the shoe to help you take off in an instant.

Hit the brakes
As you're hitting that sharp cut, the advanced traction helps you briefly stick to the ground while the other directional traction helps you dig your toe in and toe out of it. The hollow herringbone pattern helps you stop quicker.

Cushioned for Impact
When you're shifting side to side, you need support that's firm—but not rigid. A wedge of cushioning in the midsole butts up against the medial sidewall so you can bank like a champ, and a thick, moulded insole helps you stay grounded.

Kylian Mbappé's explosiveness, plus his twitchy change of direction, puts him firmly in the world class of finishers. With nods to his heritage, this boot is made to help you play just like KM—with blinding pace and purpose. We added a Zoom Air unit and grippy texture up top for exceptional touch, so you can dominate in the waning minutes of a match—when it matters most.

Welcome to the pitch, Zoom
For the first time in our history, Nike has developed an all-new Zoom Air unit. It sits in the plate and provides an additional level of springy underfoot feel that helps you move faster on the pitch and create separation when it matters the most—whether you're scoring goals, being first to the ball or going by defenders.

Drive your speed
The speed cage inside the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding additional weight for optimal lockdown.

Dig in, take off
Unique traction pattern offers super-charged traction with quick release to create separation.

Improved fit
A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better lockdown in the heel.

Barefoot feel
The upper has NikeSkin, a soft and flexible mesh material linked together by a thin coating. It helps provide ball control and truly gives you a feeling of barefoot football.

Even Legends find ways to evolve. Made to take your game to the next level, the latest iteration of this Academy boot has all-new FlyTouch Lite engineered leather. Softer than natural leather, it contours to your foot and doesn't overstretch, so you can dictate the pace of your game. Lighter and sleeker than any other Tiempo to date, the Legend 10 is for any position on the pitch, whether you're sending a pinpoint pass through the defence or tracking back to stop a break-away.

Amplified touch
See those micro-dots on the upper? They amplify touch zones for shooting, dribbling and passing. They make for a sleeker look while taking out the extra padding. Better still, they don't sacrifice the ball control you crave on the pitch. We shaved down the foam pods from the Tiempo 9, so your foot can get even closer to the ball when it's in your control. Instead, we moulded the lines into the boot.

Natural, contouring fit
The FlyTouch Lite engineered leather is incredibly soft. It helps the boot mould to your foot for comfort without overstretching the material. Tongue construction with additional padding gives you a secure feel and comfort in key strike zones. Microfibre lining creates a premium feel.

Serious about your game? The pro boot is for the pinpoint passer who can curl the ball around the defence and the inventive, yet elusive yo-yo dribbler who has the ball on a string. Your game is all about precision, making the plays that matter most. Take your skills to the next level with some of Nike's greatest innovations, like an enlarged touch zone up top. It complements a design that moves with your natural on-pitch flow, so you can command the game from any position.

Enhanced Touch
An expanded NikeSkin touch zone, powered by engineered mesh, brings your foot even closer to the ball for better control while dribbling and passing in wet or dry conditions. The upper is soft and almost knit-like while the contact zone on the inside of the boot is heightened for even better touch.

Contoured for Comfort
Asymmetry in the heel provides comfort. Soft elements in the heel make for an easy break-in process and help reduce irritation and pressure without compromising stability and structure.

Traction for the pitch
Tri-star studs work with forefoot flex grooves to provide optimal traction and help unlock change of direction. See the lines on the outsole? They match your typical on-pitch movements, which push forwards then zigzag before a strike.

Kylian Mbappé's explosiveness, plus his twitchy change of direction, puts him firmly in the world class of finishers. With nods to his heritage complementing a speed-driven design, this boot helps you play just like KM—with blinding pace, purpose and bold personality. We added a Zoom Air unit, so you can speed past your opponent with ease on the open pitch in the waning minutes of the match—when it matters most.

Welcome to the pitch, Zoom
For the first time in our history, Nike has developed an all-new Zoom Air unit. It sits in the plate and provides an extra level of springy underfoot feel that helps you move faster on the pitch and create separation when it matters the most—whether you're scoring goals, being first to the ball or going by defenders.

Drive your speed
The speed cage inside the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding extra weight for optimal support.

Dig in, take off
Unique traction pattern offers super-charged traction with quick release to create separation.

Improved fit
Flyknit wraps your ankle in soft, stretchy fabric for a secure feel. A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better support in the heel.

Barefoot feel
The upper has NikeSkin, a soft and flexible mesh material linked together by a thin coating. It helps provide ball control and truly gives you a feeling of barefoot football.

One moment can change the course of a match, season or career. When the opportunity presents itself, be ready to strike in this special Phantom Luna Elite. We used insights from female athletes to give you a traction pattern that helps you play quickly and with confidence—which every footballer needs. Designed for those obsessed with perfecting their craft, it helps you make precision cuts when the game's intensity heats up, while innovative Nike Gripknit offers exceptional touch.

Electric spark
Bolts of lightning cracking through chaotic clouds highlight a disruptive design destined to cause destruction in the sky or on the ground. A vertical Swoosh design gives your game an electric look, while an inclement-weather graphic on the plate lets your defenders know there's a storm of skill lurking on the horizon.

Traction for the pitch
Nike Cyclone 360 traction pattern helps you make quick (improved agility when making cuts) and confident (helps reduce rotational traction) movements, so you can cut with speed and force while feeling fully secure when the game's intensity turns up.

Exceptional Touch
Nike Gripknit is a sticky material that provides better touch to the ball. It covers the first 2 laces, taking up more surface area so you have more room to control the ball. It moulds to the shape of your foot and gives you equal grip in wet or dry conditions. Micro-moulding texture works with Gripknit to help form to your foot for even better boot-to-ball strikes.

Secure Fit and Feel
Asymmetric lacing offers a larger touch surface when dribbling, passing and scoring. A repositioned lacing pattern allows for increased midfoot adjustability to accommodate players with flatter or higher arches. Asymmetrical Flyknit cuff material provides snugness. Subtle ribs in the cuff allow for ball contact higher up the ankle in trapping and passing.

Soft elements in the heel and collar make for an easy break-in process.

Even Legends find ways to evolve. The latest iteration of this Elite boot has all-new FlyTouch Plus engineered leather. Softer than natural leather, it contours to your foot and works with All Conditions Control (a grippy texture even in wet weather) so you can dictate the pace of your game. Lighter and sleeker than any other Tiempo to date, the Legend 10 is for any position on the pitch, whether you're sending a pinpoint pass through the defence or tracking back to stop a break-away.

Amplified touch
See those micro-dots on the upper? They amplify touch zones for shooting, dribbling and passing. They make for a sleeker look while taking out the extra padding. Better still, they don't sacrifice the ball control you crave on the pitch. We shaved down the foam pods from the Tiempo 9, so your foot can get even closer to the ball when it's in your control. Instead, we moulded the lines into the boot. All Conditions Control (ACC) technology adds a grippy texture in both wet and dry conditions.

Natural, contouring fit
The FlyTouch Plus engineered leather is incredibly soft. It helps the boot mould to your foot for comfort without overstretching the material. Flyknit around the ankle gives you a secure feel.

Traction for the pitch
The plate places conical studs in the heel for optimal traction and stability when braking and changing direction—just right under any conditions.

It helps you make precision cuts when the match's intensity heats up, while innovative NikeSkin brings your foot closer to the ball.

Traction for the pitch
The Nike Cyclone 360 traction pattern unlocks quick and safe movements, so you can cut with speed and force while feeling fully secure when the game's intensity turns up.

Amplified touch
An expanded NikeSkin touch zone, powered by engineered mesh, brings your foot even closer to the ball for better control while dribbling and passing in wet or dry conditions. The upper is soft and almost knit-like while the contact zone on the inside of the boot is heightened for even better touch.

Secure Fit and Feel
The flat knit cuff material provides snugness and shape. Subtle ribs in the cuff allow for ball contact higher up the ankle in trapping and passing. Asymmetric lacing offers a larger touch surface when dribbling, passing and scoring. The asymmetric heel construction gives you all-game comfort and eases the initial break-in process.

One moment can change the course of a match, season or career. When the opportunity presents itself, be ready to strike in this special Phantom GX Elite. We used insights from female athletes to give you a traction pattern that helps you play quickly and with confidence—which every footballer needs. Designed for those obsessed with perfecting their craft, it helps you make precision cuts when the game's intensity heats up, while innovative Nike Gripknit offers exceptional touch.

Electric spark
Bolts of lightning cracking through chaotic clouds highlight a disruptive design destined to cause destruction in the sky or on the ground. A vertical Swoosh design gives your game an electric look, while an inclement-weather graphic on the plate lets your defenders know there's a storm of skill lurking on the horizon.

Traction for the pitch
Nike Cyclone 360 traction pattern helps you make quick (improved agility when making cuts) and confident (helps reduce rotational traction) movements, so you can cut with speed and force while feeling fully secure when the game's intensity turns up.

Exceptional Touch
Nike Gripknit is a sticky material that provides better touch to the ball. It covers the first 2 laces, taking up more surface area so you have more room to control the ball. It moulds to the shape of your foot and gives you equal grip in wet or dry conditions. Micro-moulding texture works with Gripknit to help form to your foot for even better boot-to-ball strikes.

Secure Fit and Feel
Asymmetric lacing offers a larger touch surface when dribbling, passing and scoring. A repositioned lacing pattern allows for increased midfoot adjustability to accommodate players with flatter or higher arches. Asymmetrical Flyknit cuff material provides snugness. Subtle ribs in the cuff allow for ball contact higher up the ankle in trapping and passing.

You've perfected your skill through endless training and channelled your inner fire into your craft. Now, when the weight of the match is squarely on your shoulders, rise to the occasion and deliver. Bold reds and gentle oranges speak to the fearless-yet-grounded attitude needed to embrace these pressure-packed moments. Loaded with a football-specific Zoom Air unit, the Academy boot helps you take your game to the next level and put the pedal down in the waning minutes of a match—when it matters most.

Pressure ready
Undulating, undaunted reds and soothing, rolling oranges represent the passion and adrenaline that arise when the game's pressure peaks. Repeating patterns represent the unseen training and endless repetitions that you pour into your game, so that you're ready for the pressure. The blend of technical skill and emotional drive combines for a moment of focus and clarity.

Springy underfoot feel
The heel Zoom Air unit sits in the outsole and provides an additional level of springy underfoot feel that helps you move fast on the pitch. It creates separation when it matters the most—whether you're scoring goals, being first to the ball or going by defenders.

Dig in, take off
Unique traction pattern offers super-charged traction with quick release to create separation.

Improved fit
A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and a better fit in the heel.

Drive your speed
The speed cage inside of the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding weight.

Kylian Mbappé's explosiveness, plus his twitchy change of direction, puts him firmly in the world class of finishers. With nods to his heritage, this boot is made to help you play just like KM—with blinding pace and purpose. We've added a Zoom Air unit made specifically for football and grippy texture up top for exceptional touch, so you can dominate in the waning minutes of a match—when it matters most.

Welcome to the pitch, Zoom
For the first time in our history, Nike has developed an all-new, football-specific 3/4 Zoom Air unit. It sits in the plate and provides an additional level of springy underfoot feel that helps you move faster on the pitch and create separation when it matters the most—whether you're scoring goals, being first to the ball or going by defenders.

Drive your speed
The speed cage inside the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding additional weight for optimal lockdown.

Dig in, take off
Tri-star studs provide multi-directional traction with every step, so you can change directions quickly and confidently. Heel studs provide traction and stability when braking. Toe-off centre studs give you traction during explosive starts.

Improved fit
Flyknit wraps your ankle in soft, stretchy fabric for a secure feel. A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better lockdown in the heel.

Feel the ball
The upper is made from Vaporposite+, which combines a grippy, grid mesh with a premium material for optimal ball control at high speeds. The material provides a tactile feel across the surface of the upper. It's soft but stable, and wraps tightly around your foot, giving you a more natural on-ball feel when dribbling, passing or scoring.

A basketball shoe for you and your unique game. We gathered insights from female ballers and integrated them into this edition of the AJ XXXVII Low, engineered specifically for women. Focusing the design on speed and flexibility, we swapped in full-length Formula 23 foam plus a single Zoom Air unit in the forefoot. The result? You'll feel closer to the ground, with added mobility and responsiveness. The lightweight upper features an ornate embroidery pattern that adds support (and looks cool, too). Performance, tuned for an uncompromised game—that's what we're about.

Enhanced Flexibility
Instead of a double stack of Nike Air, we went with a single Zoom Air unit, which offers you a smoother heel-to-toe transition. More flexibility means greater on-court mobility and agility.

Ten Toes Down
Full-length Formula 23 foam helps you feel lower to the ground and creates a responsive ride underfoot for more court feel and energy return.

Light and Secure
The strong, lightweight upper—designed to mimic the support given by a taped-up ankle—is made from layers of leno-weave fabric and strong plastic ribbon that hold tight without weighing you down. An ornate embroidery pattern adds even more support.

The stunning chrome effect puts even more electricity into these lightning bolts loaded with Zoom Air, which begs the question: What moments will you etch into our memories over the next 25 years?

Look the Part
Throughout the years, Volt and Hyper Pink have been used across many of the most iconic boots in the Mercurial's lineage. The Volt MXXV graphic, the Hyper Pink Swoosh logo and the Hyper Pink studs underneath offer unique expressions for this special design. A chrome effect makes the Metallic Silver base pop, highlighting the importance of the 25-year milestone.

Respecting the Past
The Mercurial has been the catalyst for some of the most memorable moments the game has produced. Using historical Mercurial logos, we created a repeating graphic that speaks to different eras dating back to 1998. The medial (big-toe side) MXXV graphic celebrates the gravity of this historic moment and connects to the boot's previous anniversary.

And with over 2,000 iterations of this staple, its impact on fashion, music and sneaker culture can't be denied.",4.4

A GORE-TEX layer helps keep out water to help your feet stay dry. A heathered foam collar helps your ankle stay warm while working to keep extra debris and water from getting inside the shoe.

Secure feel
Cables integrate with the laces for a secure feel, specifically in the midfoot, while the inner sleeve wraps your midfoot for a sock-like fit.

Smooth run
A generative traction pattern combined with rubber lugs gives you grip when going uphill or downhill. It provides enhanced grip on the trail and a smoother transition on the road.

Bounce to the Beat
Zoom Air units and full-length ZoomX foam deliver Nike's highest energy return cushioning system, adding more bounce into every step. A thin rubber outsole enhances traction and allows for more ZoomX under the Zoom Air cushioning. The additional foam not only adds more bounce, but also helps improve transition from heel to forefoot.

Stay Fresher, Longer
Full-length ZoomX foam offers an ultra-lightweight and responsive ride. It's built for speed but also provides cushioning to stay fresh even in the late miles of a marathon. It offers comfort where you need it.

Keep Rolling
Full-length carbon-fibre plate delivers a sort of roll-forwards feel that makes you want to take on the next step. It gives you a propulsive sensation and helps you transition smoothly through your stride. Both the forefoot and heel offer slightly wider bases for a stable platform, so you can tackle turns on the course with confidence.

Waffle-inspired pattern provides traction for the road.
An extra flex groove offers a smooth toe-off."," 
A springy ride for any run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot.

The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot.

More benefits
The heel area optimises the landing space and improves transition and durability.
Waffle-inspired pattern provides traction for the road.
An extra flex groove offers a smooth toe-off.

A springy ride for any run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run.

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made from our all-new Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam, to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces its carbon footprint in a pair of midsoles by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam.*) We coupled the ReactX foam with Nike Running's best-fitting Flyknit yet, so you can take off any time, anywhere with secure upper support and breathability. It's the kind of shoe that can grant you that priceless peace of mind to go faster and further, thanks to an intuitive design that supports every stride. *The carbon footprint of ReactX is based on a cradle-to-gate assessment reviewed by PRé Sustainability B.V. and Intertek China. Other midsole components such as airbags, plates or other foam formulations were not considered.

What's new about the Nike InfinityRN 4?
This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with the new ReactX foam delivering more support. The revamped Flyknit upper and wider toe box help your foot feel stable and secure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride. A new internal Flyknit fit band (like a rubber band around the middle of your foot) offers elastic, secure support.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

A water-repellent liner in the toe helps keep you dry when the weather turns.

Waffle-inspired pattern provides traction for the road.
An extra flex groove offers a smooth toe-off."," 
A springy ride for every run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot. Suede material allows it to provide better fit without irritation, from your 1st run to your last run.

The Invincible 3 has high-support technology, with cushion and stability intentionally placed and shaped to protect your foot from the effects of pronation.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. With Nike ZoomX cushioning shaped like a rocker and higher foam heights, this shoe is so soft and bouncy that just by putting it on you'll be excited for your next run. It gives you ultimate cushioning on ground contact and an even softer underfoot feel for your workout and beyond.

Responsiveness: super-high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. Nike ZoomX foam is ultra-responsive and lightweight, giving you bounce and a snappy response with every step.

Fit: secure, breathable, comfortable
An evolved Flyknit upper places zones of breathability where your foot heats up most. It's strong and durable, helping keep your foot secure with every mile.

What's new about the Invincible 3?
A wider midsole adds more stability than our previous iteration. Taller foam stacks than our previous version raise the bar on cushioning and comfort, in a more sleek-looking design. The strong plastic going around the heel is smaller than our previous iteration while still providing a secure, comfortable fit.

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made from our all-new Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam, to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces its carbon footprint in a pair of midsoles by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam.*) We coupled the ReactX foam with Nike Running's best-fitting Flyknit yet, so you can feel confident in every stride with soft upper support and breathability. It's the kind of shoe that supports every step in style. *The carbon footprint of ReactX is based on a cradle-to-gate assessment reviewed by PRé Sustainability B.V. and Intertek China. Other midsole components such as airbags, plates or other foam formulations were not considered.

What's new about the Nike InfinityRN 4?
This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with the new ReactX foam delivering more support. The revamped Flyknit upper and wider toe box help your foot feel stable and secure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride. A new internal Flyknit fit band (like a rubber band around the middle of your foot) offers elastic, secure support.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Catch 'em if you can. Giving you race-day speed to conquer any distance, the Nike Vaporfly 3 is made for the chasers, the racers and the elevated pacers who can't turn down the thrill of the pursuit. We reworked the leader of the super shoe pack and tuned the engine underneath to help you chase personal bests from a 10K to marathon. From elite runners to those new to racing, this versatile road-racing workhorse is for those who see speed as a gateway to more miles and more seemingly uncatchable highs.

Propelling You Forwards
A full-length carbon fibre flyplate provides a stiff and propulsive feel.

Speed for Miles
Nike ZoomX, our most responsive foam, just got a little better. Running from heel to toe, it unlocks even more energy return than before, giving you a springy, bouncy feel.

Stable Ride
See how the midsole bulges out by the heel? We designed it that way to help reduce weight on the inside of the foot to give you a more stable ride.

Feel the Breeze
Specifically selected Flyknit yarns and engineered zones in the forefoot bring a new level of performance to the Vaporfly. Ample breathability around the toes combined with soft, yet supportive yarns deliver our most customised upper for the Vaporfly. The result is a softer, cooler design that contours to your foot.

What's New About the Vaporfly 3?
An updated thin outsole rubber uses less material without sacrificing durability, which helps reduce outsole weight and thickness. This allows for extra millimetres of ZoomX foam underfoot and a smoother transition through your stride.

Your workhorse with wings returns to help you push through the rain. A water-repellent finish helps keep you dry while a cosy fleece-like feel on the inside helps keep your feet warm for nasty-weather runs. Rugged traction and 2 Zoom Air units provide grip and soft cushioning, so you can power through the elements.

Warmth for Your Feet
Like a warm jacket for your feet, knit material in the upper helps keep your feet warm. Skins placed around the toes—in areas where water can seep in—help to keep you dry. Insulation on the back of the tongue helps your feet stay warm and comfortable.

Dry Design
A water-repellent finish and gusseted tongue work together to help keep your feet dry. Heathered lining in the collar helps keep your ankle warm and dry.

Rain-Ready Traction
The Storm-Tread outsole provides traction in wet weather. It has textures inspired by winter tyres. Micro grooves grab the road, while multi-directional shapes help shed water for direct contact with the tarmac.

Smooth Transition
Nike React technology is a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a smooth, responsive ride. We paired it with 2 Zoom Air units (at the forefoot and heel) for an energised feel at toe-off. The result is a smooth transition from heel to toe.

The more cushioning that you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Packed with our premium ZoomX and Cushlon foams, the Vomero 17 delivers comfort underfoot for a balanced, soft stride. Based on runner feedback, we also removed the forefoot Zoom Air unit in the previous version to simplify the midsole for a more plush feel.

Responsiveness: super-high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. In the Vomero 17, our maximum spring shoe, your foot sits on a stack of ZoomX—Nike Running's lightest and highest energy-returning foam—on the top and soft foam on the bottom, for an energised yet smooth ride.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Vomero 17 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe that helps complement your natural stride.

Fit and Feel
This shoe prides itself on premium comfort that puts you in cruise control for short-to-long miles. Engineered mesh makes for a lighter and more breathable upper compared with previous Vomeros. A plush insole offers comfort upon entry, and a soft collar feels gentle on your heel once it's time to run. The padded tongue and soft, stretchy laces top off an ultra-comfortable overall experience.

What's new about the Vomero 17?
We simplified the build of the 17 by removing the forefoot Zoom Air unit and stacking premium ZoomX foam on top of the midsole to amplify the cushioned comfort. The result is a softer, more responsive ride.

More benefits
High-abrasion rubber with lugs on the outsole gives you durable traction.
Flexible outsole helps improve your heel-to-toe transition.

An extra flex groove offers a smooth toe-off."," 
A springy ride for every run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot. Suede material allows it to provide better fit without irritation, from your 1st run to your last run.

With maximum cushioning to support every mile, the Invincible 3 has our highest level of comfort underfoot. Its plush and bouncy ZoomX foam helps you stay stable and fresh. In other words—it's going to feel good all day, whatever you're doing. It has everything you need so you can propel down your preferred path and come back for your next run feeling ready and reinvigorated.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Invincible 3 has high-support technology, with cushion and stability intentionally placed and shaped to protect your foot from the effects of pronation.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. With Nike ZoomX cushioning shaped like a rocker and higher foam heights, this shoe is so soft and bouncy that just by putting it on you'll be excited for your next run. It gives you ultimate cushioning on ground contact and an even softer underfoot feel for your workout and beyond.

Responsiveness: super-high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. Nike ZoomX foam is ultra-responsive and lightweight, giving you bounce and a snappy response with every step.

Fit: secure, breathable, comfortable
An evolved Flyknit upper places zones of breathability where your foot heats up most. It's strong and durable, helping keep your foot secure with every mile.

What's new about the Invincible 3?
A wider midsole adds more stability than our previous iteration. Taller foam stacks than our previous version raise the bar on cushioning and comfort, in a more sleek-looking design. The strong plastic going around the heel is smaller than our previous iteration while still providing a secure, comfortable fit.

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made from our all-new Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam, to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces its carbon footprint in a pair of midsoles by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam.*) We coupled the ReactX foam with Nike Running's best-fitting Flyknit yet, so you can feel confident in every stride with soft upper support and breathability. It's the kind of shoe that supports every step in style. *The carbon footprint of ReactX is based on a cradle-to-gate assessment reviewed by PRé Sustainability B.V. and Intertek China. Other midsole components such as airbags, plates or other foam formulations were not considered.

What's new about the Nike InfinityRN 4?
This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with the new ReactX foam delivering more support. The revamped Flyknit upper and wider toe box help your foot feel stable and secure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride. A new internal Flyknit fit band (like a rubber band around the middle of your foot) offers elastic, secure support.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Contained breathability
A water-repellent liner in the toe helps keep you dry when the weather turns.

The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride. A new internal Flyknit fit band (like a rubber band around the middle of your foot) offers elastic, secure support.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Contained breathability
A water-repellent liner in the toe helps keep you dry when the weather turns.

More benefits
Waffle outsole provides durable traction.
Flyknit tongue is adjustable and plush.
Foam collar is soft and supportive to the touch.
Increased rubber at the outsole gives traction and durability.

Catch 'em if you can. Giving you race-day speed to conquer any distance, the Nike Vaporfly 3 is made for the chasers, the racers and the elevated pacers who can't turn down the thrill of the pursuit. We reworked the leader of the super shoe pack and tuned the engine underneath to help you chase personal bests from a 10K to marathon. From elite runners to those new to racing, this versatile road-racing workhorse is for those who see speed as a gateway to more miles and more seemingly uncatchable highs.

Propelling You Forwards
A full-length carbon fibre flyplate provides a stiff and propulsive feel.

Speed for Miles
Nike ZoomX, our most responsive foam, just got a little better. Running from heel to toe, it unlocks even more energy return than before, giving you a springy, bouncy feel.

Stable Ride
See how the midsole bulges out by the heel? We designed it that way to help reduce weight on the inside of the foot to give you a more stable ride.

Feel the Breeze
Specifically selected Flyknit yarns and engineered zones in the forefoot bring a new level of performance to the Vaporfly. Ample breathability around the toes combined with soft, yet supportive yarns deliver our most customised upper for the Vaporfly. The result is a softer, cooler design that contours to your foot.

What's New About the Vaporfly 3?
An updated thin outsole rubber uses less material without sacrificing durability, which helps reduce outsole weight and thickness. This allows for extra millimetres of ZoomX foam underfoot and a smoother transition through your stride.

Your workhorse with wings returns to help you push through the rain. A water-repellent finish helps keep you dry while a cosy fleece-like feel on the inside helps keep your feet warm for nasty-weather runs. Rugged traction and 2 Zoom Air units provide grip and soft cushioning, so you can power through the elements.

Warmth for Your Feet
Like a warm jacket for your feet, knit material in the upper helps keep your feet warm. Skins placed around the toes—in areas where water can seep in—help to keep you dry. Insulation on the back of the tongue helps your feet stay warm and comfortable.

Dry Design
A water-repellent finish and gusseted tongue work together to help keep your feet dry. Heathered lining in the collar helps keep your ankle warm and dry.

Rain-Ready Traction
The Storm-Tread outsole provides traction in wet weather. It has textures inspired by winter tyres. Micro grooves grab the road, while multi-directional shapes help shed water for direct contact with the tarmac.

Smooth Transition
Nike React technology is a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a smooth, responsive ride. We paired it with 2 Zoom Air units (at the forefoot and heel) for an energised feel at toe-off. The result is a smooth transition from heel to toe.

A springy and soft ride to energise every mile, the Vomero 17 takes you to your running happy place. Its stacked foam provides premium responsiveness to help you kick it up a notch when you're ready for that extra gear. And with across-the-board enhancements that deliver a new level of lightweight comfort and breathability, this shoe's style and plush feel help you look good and feel confident in every stride.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning that you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Packed with our premium ZoomX and Cushlon foams, the Vomero 17 delivers comfort underfoot for a balanced, soft stride. Based on runner feedback, we also removed the forefoot Zoom Air unit in the previous version to simplify the midsole for a more plush feel.

Responsiveness: super-high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. In the Vomero 17, our maximum spring shoe, your foot sits on a stack of ZoomX—Nike Running's lightest and highest energy-returning foam—on the top and soft foam on the bottom, for an energised yet smooth ride.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Vomero 17 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe that helps complement your natural stride.

Fit and Feel
This shoe prides itself on premium comfort that puts you in cruise control for short-to-long miles. Engineered mesh makes for a lighter and more breathable upper compared with previous Vomeros. A plush insole offers comfort upon entry, and a soft collar feels gentle on your heel once it's time to run. The padded tongue and soft, stretchy laces top off an ultra-comfortable overall experience.

What's new about the Vomero 17?
We simplified the build of the 17 by removing the forefoot Zoom Air unit and stacking premium ZoomX foam on top of the midsole to amplify the cushioned comfort. The result is a softer, more responsive ride.

More benefits
High-abrasion rubber with lugs on the outsole gives you durable traction.
Flexible outsole helps improve your heel-to-toe transition.

With stability where you need it and cushion where you want it, the Structure 25 supports you for long miles, short training runs and even a down-and-back before the day ends. It's the stability you seek, loyal from the first tie-up, tried and tested, with a midfoot system that's fully supportive and with more comfortable cushioning than before.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Structure 25 is all about providing stability for every stride. The updated foam midsole works with wider midfoot support and an increased rocker to give you a more stable platform underfoot and smoother transitions from heel to toe.

Cushioning: high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. New-and-improved foam on the midsole provides a soft and comfortable feel as you log your miles. High foam stacks help keep you comfortable. Shaped like a rocker, the foam provides support for the 3 phases of a runner's stride. It offers flexibility when your foot rises off the ground, a smooth ride when your foot is moving forwards and cushioning at ground contact.

Responsiveness: minimum
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. A Zoom Air unit in the forefoot offers responsive cushioning. Every step helps create energy return to help drive you forwards with a springy, responsive sensation.

Accommodating fit
The accommodating forefoot allows you plenty of space to spread out your toes. The wider forefoot complements a wider base and smooth ride. Added structure and containment around the heel provides a more supportive fit.

What's new about the Structure 25?
We added even more foam than our previous Structures, with better support and comfort than its predecessor as well. The new-and-improved foam underfoot helps give you support.

Progress, experimentation and craft. With a modular design and innovative components, the ISPA Universal lets you step into the future of footwear. Inspired by three Nike icons (the Air Max 270, the Zoom Type and the Solarsoft HTM), we harnessed computer-driven data to create a one-of-a-kind look. Every pair is buffed by hand, resulting in a unique artisan finish that differs from shoe to shoe. Breath of fresh air, anyone?

Modular, No-Glue Design
Replaceable components and zero glue means less waste with every pair of shoes.

Future Foam
Bio-EVA foam, used throughout the design, is made from bio-based feedstocks derived from sugarcane. (Translation? We're working to replace petroleum-based ingredients with alternatives as we continue our Move to Zero journey towards zero carbon and zero waste.)

Extra Insole
Each pair comes with two sets of moisture-absorbing, 40% cork insoles—once the first set breaks down, you can simply replace the insole instead of replacing the whole shoe.

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made from our all-new Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam, to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces its carbon footprint in a pair of midsoles by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam.*) This version has GORE-TEX fabric to help you stay dry for your miles. It's the kind of shoe that supports every step in style. *The carbon footprint of ReactX is based on a cradle-to-gate assessment reviewed by PRé Sustainability B.V. and Intertek China. Other midsole components such as airbags, plates or other foam formulations were not considered.

What's new about the Nike InfinityRN 4?
This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with ReactX foam delivering more support. The wider toe box helps your foot feel stable and secure.

Dry Design
Waterproof GORE-TEX fabric helps keep you dry so you can focus on the adventure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Reliable Traction
A Storm Tread outsole provides reliable traction on wet and slippery surfaces. The rubber wraps around the front of the shoe for extra durability. Its generative traction pattern combined with rubber lugs gives you grip when going uphill or downhill.

This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with ReactX foam delivering more support. The wider toe box helps your foot feel stable and secure.

Dry Design
Waterproof GORE-TEX fabric helps keep you dry so you can focus on the adventure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Reliable Traction
A Storm Tread outsole provides reliable traction on wet and slippery surfaces. The rubber wraps around the front of the shoe for extra durability. Its generative traction pattern combined with rubber lugs gives you grip when going uphill or downhill.

More benefits
A water-repellent liner in the toe helps keep you dry when the weather turns.
Foam collar is soft and supportive to the touch.
Increased rubber on the outsole gives traction and durability.

Our lightest racing shoe, the Nike Streakfly is all about the speed you need to take on the competition in a mile, 5K or 10K race. Low profile with sleek details, it feels like it disappears on your foot to help you better connect with the road on the way to your personal best.

Low and Nimble
A full-length ZoomX midsole provides optimal lightweight responsiveness. The foam stack heights are lower than the Vaporfly, saving weight and giving you a more aggressive feel. It results in a shoe so light it disappears on your foot, while still giving you the responsive cushioning of ZoomX foam, helping you reach your fastest pace throughout the turns and accelerations of any race.

Supportive and Sleek
An ultra-thin knit upper is light in weight while still providing the support you need for racing. Extra reinforcement in the forefoot helps keep you secure. The updated, sleek lacing system is laterally offset with a notched tongue to help relieve pressure on the top of the foot.

Grip Where It Counts
Runner-informed data was used to create the outsole. It uses that information to place traction where you need it the most, with a pattern that connects to the pavement based on how your foot hits the ground. The result is solid grip from foot contact to toe-off, helping you stay ahead of the competition.

Nasty weather doesn't need to put an end to your run. Revel in the elements with these shoes designed to help you push through every puddle, pit stop, pothole and personal record. A water-repellent finish helps keep you dry while tyre-like traction and a full-length Air unit provide grip and soft cushioning to help keep you running when conditions get slick.

Warmth for Your Feet
Like a warm jacket for your feet, the upper has knit material to help keep you warm for cold-weather runs. Skins placed around the toes—in areas where water can seep in—help to keep you dry.

Dry Design
A water-repellent finish and gusseted tongue work together to help keep your feet dry.

Rain-Ready Traction
The Storm-Tread outsole provides traction in wet weather. It has textures inspired by winter tyres. Micro grooves grab the road, while multi-directional shapes help shed water for direct contact with the tarmac.

Cushioning for Miles
A full-length Nike Air unit puts cushioning where you need it. A soft and responsive foam midsole puts more springiness in your step.

Insulating Comfort
Insulation on the back of the tongue helps the top of your feet stay comfortable. Heathered lining and structured insulation on the inside help keep things feeling warm and cosy even when your running conditions are anything but.

Waffle-inspired pattern provides traction for the road.
An extra flex groove offers a smooth toe-off."," 
A springy ride for every run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot. Suede material allows it to provide better fit without irritation, from your 1st run to your last run.

The heel area optimises the landing space and improves transition and durability.
Waffle-inspired pattern provides traction for the road.
An extra flex groove offers a smooth toe-off.

Air Max 97
We realise the origin of the Air Max 97 has become something of an urban myth. (Let's set the story straight: it was a water droplet that inspired the ripple design—not high-speed bullet trains.) Still, the influence of the 97 remains undeniable. It was, in essence, a vision of the future. An icon that made other icons possible. Unlike anything that had come before, it revolutionised the sneaker world with full-length Air cushioning and an innovative hidden lacing system. Originally made for performance running, these shoes were quickly adopted as streetwear by high-fashion destinations like Milan and beloved by creatives and artists alike to cement their place in sneaker history.",4.6

A springy ride for any run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot.

A familiar favourite is reborn in the Nike BRSB. Almost every detail, from the colour-blocking to the sawtooth pattern on the sole, was inspired by the original Nike Cortez. But, because this shoe is built for skate, we added extras where they're needed—like the rubber from the sole that wraps up and over the heel and toe for durability. It also wraps the sides, adding an extra layer to high-use areas, like the ollie zone.

A foam midsole delivers a soft, smooth ride. There's a little more room in the forefoot compared to the 6 as well, so your toes don't feel tight or pinched.

Soft Touch
We added puffs to the heel that are visible on the outside of the shoe. They're soft to the touch and help add comfort to your Achilles. Touch points on the tongue create a natural feel as you take off.

Reassuring grip
The outsole sports a generative traction pattern that combines with rubber lugs to help give you grip when going uphill or downhill.",3.5

And play ...
The upper combines leather, textile and suede for a layered look with a focus on comfort, style and durability.

And everything in between
The past meets the future in this updated Futura icon. The upper keeps the fluid look of the original, while the redesigned hidden lacing system adds a fun twist.

Air Max 97
We realise the origin of the Air Max 97 has become something of an urban myth. (Let's set the story straight: it was a water droplet that inspired the ripple design—not high-speed bullet trains.) Still, the influence of the 97 remains undeniable. It was, in essence, a vision of the future. An icon that made other icons possible. Unlike anything that had come before, it revolutionised the sneaker world with full-length Air cushioning and an innovative hidden lacing system. Originally made for performance running, these shoes were quickly adopted as streetwear by high-fashion destinations like Milan and beloved by creatives and artists alike to cement their place in sneaker history.",4.6

A springy ride for any run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting fit and feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's new about the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot.

When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, as though the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot.

More benefits
The heel area optimises the landing space and improves transition and durability.
Waffle-inspired pattern provides traction for the road.
An extra flex groove offers a smooth toe-off.

A springy ride for any run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

A familiar favourite is reborn in the Nike BRSB. Almost every detail, from the colour-blocking to the sawtooth pattern on the sole, was inspired by the original Nike Cortez. But, because this shoe is built for skate, we added extras where they're needed—like the rubber from the sole that wraps up and over the heel and toe for durability. It also wraps the sides, adding an extra layer to high-use areas, like the ollie zone.

Nike Air VaporMax
After the 7-year journey from conception to release, the Air VaporMax represents a new era in Nike innovation.

Made for runners, the futuristic technology was quickly adopted by the street, bringing this light-as-air feeling to the masses.",4.6

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made with our Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces the carbon footprint of the midsole by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam, so it helps support the planet, too). We coupled the ReactX foam with Nike Running's best-fitting Flyknit yet, so you can take off any time, anywhere with secure upper support and breathability. It's the kind of shoe that can grant you that priceless peace of mind to go faster and further, thanks to an intuitive design that supports every stride.

What's new about the Nike InfinityRN 4?
This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with ReactX foam delivering more support. The revamped Flyknit upper and wider toe box help your foot feel stable and secure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride. An internal Flyknit fit band (like a rubber band around the middle of your foot) offers elastic, secure support.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Contained breathability
A water-repellent liner in the toe helps keep you dry when the weather turns.

Flyknit tongue is adjustable and plush.

Whatever your ""why"" is for working out, the Metcon 9 makes it all worth it. We improved on the 8 with a larger Hyperlift plate and added rubber rope wrap. Intended for lifters, trainers and go-getters, some of the greatest athletes in the world swear by it, and it's still the gold standard that delivers day after day.

Tougher and Stronger
We made the Hyperlift plate in the heel even bigger for stability when tackling tough workouts like Split Squats, Dead Lifts and other lower-body exercises. The plate helps force weight down and out while adding rigidity in the heel. That firmness helps you feel grounded and supported, specifically under heavier loads.

Secure feel
The lace-lock system attaches to the shoe tongue, so you don't have to worry about latching it to any fabric. It helps keep your laces in place, so once you tie up, you can focus solely on your workout.

Go to the Top
We extended the rubber wrap on the side for durability and support so that you can scale any kind of rope climb with the same repeated velocity without worrying about wear and tear. It stretches from the midsole to the upper and adds some support in the upper for multi-directional movements.

Durable and Cool
The lightweight, breathable mesh helps keep your foot cool yet sports the kind of durability that can withstand scrapes, slashes and quick-drag movements.

A balanced ride to help kick-start your run, the Winflo 10 is great whether you're a creature of habit logging your weekly mileage, a rookie hoping to turn intrigue into routine or just joining a friend for a spontaneous weekend run. A neutral support shoe with springy Nike Air, plus more space in the forefoot, leads to a comfortable, bouncy feel. It's ready-made for your run, whenever the road is calling your name.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Winflo 10 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Full-length Nike Air cushioning gives you a soft, comfortable feel for your miles.

Responsiveness: Medium
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. Soft foam in the midsole works with the Nike Air cushioning to give you a bouncy, springy feel.

What's New About the Winflo 10?
A revamped toe box provides a better fit for all foot types compared to the Winflo 9. Plus, we increased the collar comfort and fit, with padding where it counts most.

Whatever your ""why"" is for working out, the Metcon 9 makes it all worth it. We improved on the 8 with a larger Hyperlift plate and added rubber rope wrap. Intended for lifters, trainers and go-getters, some of the greatest athletes in the world swear by it, and it's still the gold standard that delivers day after day.

Tougher and Stronger
We made the Hyperlift plate in the heel even bigger for stability when tackling tough workouts like Split Squats, Dead Lifts and other lower-body exercises. The plate helps force weight down and out while adding rigidity in the heel. That firmness helps you feel grounded and supported, specifically under heavier loads.

Secure feel
The lace-lock system attaches to the shoe tongue, so you don't have to worry about latching it to any fabric. It helps keep your laces in place, so once you tie up, you can focus solely on your workout.

Go to the Top
We extended the rubber wrap on the side for durability and support so that you can scale any kind of rope climb with the same repeated velocity without worrying about wear and tear. It stretches from the midsole to the upper and adds some support in the upper for multi-directional movements.

Durable and Cool
The lightweight, breathable mesh helps keep your foot cool yet sports the kind of durability that can withstand scrapes, slashes and quick-drag movements.

Feel the Foam
A dual-density midsole—firm foam on the outside, soft foam on the inside—provides responsive cushioning for lasting comfort for continuous cardio and movements.

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made with our Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces the carbon footprint of the midsole by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam, so it helps support the planet, too). We coupled the ReactX foam with Nike Running's best-fitting Flyknit yet, so you can take off any time, anywhere with secure upper support and breathability. It's the kind of shoe that can grant you that priceless peace of mind to go faster and further, thanks to an intuitive design that supports every stride.

What's new about the Nike InfinityRN 4?
This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with ReactX foam delivering more support. The revamped Flyknit upper and wider toe box help your foot feel stable and secure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride. An internal Flyknit fit band (like a rubber band around the middle of your foot) offers elastic, secure support.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Contained breathability
A water-repellent liner in the toe helps keep you dry when the weather turns.

Whatever your ""why"" is for working out, the Metcon 9 makes it all worth it. We improved on the 8 with a larger Hyperlift plate and added rubber rope wrap. Intended for lifters, trainers and go-getters, some of the greatest athletes in the world swear by it, and it's still the gold standard that delivers day after day.

Tougher and Stronger
We made the Hyperlift plate in the heel even bigger for stability when tackling tough workouts like Split Squats, Dead Lifts and other lower-body exercises. The plate helps force weight down and out while adding rigidity in the heel. That firmness helps you feel grounded and supported, specifically under heavier loads.

Secure feel
The lace-lock system attaches to the shoe tongue, so you don't have to worry about latching it to any fabric. It helps keep your laces in place, so once you tie up, you can focus solely on your workout.

Go to the Top
We extended the rubber wrap on the side for durability and support so that you can scale any kind of rope climb with the same repeated velocity without worrying about wear and tear. It stretches from the midsole to the upper and adds some support in the upper for multi-directional movements.

Durable and Cool
The lightweight, breathable mesh helps keep your foot cool yet sports the kind of durability that can withstand scrapes, slashes and quick-drag movements.

A balanced ride to help kick-start your run, the Winflo 10 is great whether you're a creature of habit logging your weekly mileage, a rookie hoping to turn intrigue into routine or just joining a friend for a spontaneous weekend run. A neutral support shoe with springy Nike Air, plus more space in the forefoot, leads to a comfortable, bouncy feel. It's ready-made for your run, whenever the road is calling your name.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Winflo 10 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Full-length Nike Air cushioning gives you a soft, comfortable feel for your miles.

Responsiveness: Medium
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. Soft foam in the midsole works with the Nike Air cushioning to give you a bouncy, springy feel.

What's New About the Winflo 10?
A revamped toe box provides a better fit for all foot types compared to the Winflo 9. Plus, we increased the collar comfort and fit, with padding where it counts most.

Whatever your ""why"" is for working out, the Metcon 9 makes it all worth it. We improved on the 8 with a larger Hyperlift plate and added rubber rope wrap. Intended for lifters, trainers and go-getters, some of the greatest athletes in the world swear by it, and it's still the gold standard that delivers day after day.

Tougher and Stronger
We made the Hyperlift plate in the heel even bigger for stability when tackling tough workouts like Split Squats, Dead Lifts and other lower-body exercises. The plate helps force weight down and out while adding rigidity in the heel. That firmness helps you feel grounded and supported, specifically under heavier loads.

Secure feel
The lace-lock system attaches to the shoe tongue, so you don't have to worry about latching it to any fabric. It helps keep your laces in place, so once you tie up, you can focus solely on your workout.

Go to the Top
We extended the rubber wrap on the side for durability and support so that you can scale any kind of rope climb with the same repeated velocity without worrying about wear and tear. It stretches from the midsole to the upper and adds some support in the upper for multi-directional movements.

Durable and Cool
The lightweight, breathable mesh helps keep your foot cool yet sports the kind of durability that can withstand scrapes, slashes and quick-drag movements.

Feel the Foam
A dual-density midsole—firm foam on the outside, soft foam on the inside—provides responsive cushioning for lasting comfort for continuous cardio and movements.

The Nike MC Trainer 2 can help you shift from circuit training in the weight room to the Astroturf for quick-twitch conditioning, seamlessly. It's a multi-purpose power that combines versatility, stability and longevity to help you stay locked in on the physical task at hand. From back squats to sprint repeats, it can help support the rigours of your diverse training programme without having to make a pit stop to grab more gear for your workout.

Stable Strength
The flat base is wider around the heel to help stabilise your foot while you work with weights. Overlays around the toe and laces add durability to stand up to the rigours of the gym.

Move It from Side to Side
Support wraps from the heel up to the sides for a snug fit when you tighten the laces. Soft foam provides supportive cushioning and rises at the sides to help brace your foot during lateral moves.

Thick and Thin Traction
Rubber tread gives you traction from the turf to the training room floor. It's thicker under the heel for stability while you lift, and thinner in the front for flexibility during short runs or speed drills.

With stability where you need it and cushion where you want it, the Structure 25 supports you for long miles, short training runs and even a down-and-back before the day ends. It's the stability you seek, loyal from the first tie-up, tried and tested, with a midfoot system that's fully supportive and with more comfortable cushioning than before.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Structure 25 is all about providing stability for every stride. The updated foam midsole works with wider midfoot support and an increased rocker to give you a more stable platform underfoot and smoother transitions from heel to toe.

Cushioning: high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. New-and-improved foam on the midsole provides a soft and comfortable feel as you log your miles. High foam stacks help keep you comfortable. Shaped like a rocker, the foam provides support for the 3 phases of a runner's stride. It offers flexibility when your foot rises off the ground, a smooth ride when your foot is moving forwards and cushioning at ground contact.

Responsiveness: minimum
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. A Zoom Air unit in the forefoot offers responsive cushioning. Every step helps create energy return to help drive you forwards with a springy, responsive sensation.

Accommodating fit
The accommodating forefoot allows you plenty of space to spread out your toes. The wider forefoot complements a wider base and smooth ride. Added structure and containment around the heel provides a more supportive fit.

What's new about the Structure 25?
We added even more foam than our previous Structures, with better support and comfort than its predecessor as well. The new-and-improved foam underfoot helps give you support.

We added even more foam than our previous Structures, with better support and comfort than its predecessor as well. The new-and-improved foam underfoot helps give you support.

More benefits
We softened the materials on the inside of the heel, collar and tongue, so that any part of the shoe that's touching your ankle feels smooth and comfortable.
Single-layer mesh provides breathability and durability.
The durable rubber sole has grooves in the forefoot to create flexibility, and vertical grooves down the side help create stability.

Upper is strategically zoned to hug the foot for containment and stability during quick, active movements.
Lightweight foam in the midsole went through a finer grinding process for a softer, more comfortable feel for everyday wear.
Flex grooves on the sole let your foot bend naturally.
Rubber on the outsole is strategically placed in the toe tip, forefoot and heel to address the high-wear areas and enhance the overall durability and traction.","WREAK HAVOC ON YOUR WORKOUT, NOT THE PLANET.

The new Nike SuperRep Go 3 Flyknit Shoe is a radical design story rooted in sustainability and innovation. The zoned Flyknit construction wraps your foot in 360 degrees of comfort and support. A finely ground, reclaimed foam midsole gives you responsive cushioning for high-impact training. The lightweight, packable design lets you keep them close, no matter where your next workout takes you.

Mindful Design
Made from recycled materials to lessen the impact on our planet, it features a stretchy zonal Flyknit upper construction that is made from recycled fibres and is strategically zoned for added containment during movement. Modified Crater Foam with Nike Grind material was used in the midsole for improved comfort, stability and durability.

Packable. Lightweight. Durable.
Designed with versatility in mind, the lightweight modifications to the upper, midsole and outsole give you a flexible shoe made for more than just your next HIIT class. Equipped to tackle your most challenging plyometrics, yet comfortable enough to wear around town. When it's not on your foot, you'll want to keep this shoe close. The lightweight packability of the new design makes that easy.

Less Shoe, More You
In an effort to minimise waste through an efficient method of construction, Nike designers cored out portions of the midsole, resulting in a lighter feel. The rubber on the outsole is placed in high-wear areas only—achieving an efficient design that gives you everything you need and nothing you don't.

A balanced ride to help kick-start your run, the Winflo 10 is great whether you're a creature of habit logging your weekly mileage, a rookie hoping to turn intrigue into routine or just joining a friend for a spontaneous weekend run. A neutral support shoe with springy Nike Air, plus more space in the forefoot, leads to a comfortable, bouncy feel. It's ready-made for your run, whenever the road is calling your name.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Winflo 10 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Full-length Nike Air cushioning gives you a soft, comfortable feel for your miles.

Responsiveness: Medium
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. Soft foam in the midsole works with the Nike Air cushioning to give you a bouncy, springy feel.

What's New About the Winflo 10?
A revamped toe box provides a better fit for all foot types compared to the Winflo 9. Plus, we increased the collar comfort and fit, with padding where it counts most.

On the 10th anniversary of possibly the most popular Tiger Woods shoe ever, we're re-releasing the iconic design as our 1st true Tiger retro, an ahead-of-its-time game-changer. It offers the unique fit and feel of Nike Free technology for all-round comfort and roaring post-putt fist pumps. The outsole helps keep you steady, so you can channel your Tiger-esque club twirls after ripping a massive tee shot down the middle of the fairway.

Behind the Design
The inspiration behind the Nike TW '13 began with Tiger himself. An avid enthusiast of Nike Free shoes away from the links, he asked for a golf shoe that gave him the same fit and feel as the shoes that he ran, lifted and trained in. The result was a combination of comfort and performance that changed golf shoes as we know them.

Swing Through
The engineered outsole mimics and conforms to the natural motion of the foot, coupled with the traction of a lightweight performance golf shoe. This innovative outsole helps you to keep contact with the ground longer, better harnessing the energy of the foot to the shoe and, therefore, the shoe to the ground.

Fitted Feel
Nike's Dynamic Fit system offers targeted support, delivering strength-to-weight ratio and 1-to-1 fitted support. Flywire-infused nylon straps extend 360 degrees from the footbed to the lacing system, securing the foot for an adaptive fit that provides golfers stability with mobility.

Updated removable spikes and spike receptacles provide exceptional grip.",0.0

The Nike MC Trainer 2 can help you shift from circuit training in the weight room to the Astroturf for quick-twitch conditioning, seamlessly. It's a multi-purpose power that combines versatility, stability and longevity to help you stay locked in on the physical task at hand. From back squats to sprint repeats, it can help support the rigours of your diverse training programme without having to make a pit stop to grab more gear for your workout.

Stable Strength
The flat base is wider around the heel to help stabilise your foot while you work with weights. Overlays around the toe and laces add durability to stand up to the rigours of the gym.

Move It from Side to Side
Support wraps from the heel up to the sides for a snug fit when you tighten the laces. Soft foam provides supportive cushioning and rises at the sides to help brace your foot during lateral moves.

Thick and Thin Traction
Rubber tread gives you traction from the turf to the training room floor. It's thicker under the heel for stability while you lift, and thinner in the front for flexibility during short runs or speed drills.

With stability where you need it and cushion where you want it, the Structure 25 supports you for long miles, short training runs and even a down-and-back before the day ends. It's the stability you seek, loyal from the first tie-up, tried and tested, with a midfoot system that's fully supportive and with more comfortable cushioning than before.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Structure 25 is all about providing stability for every stride. The updated foam midsole works with wider midfoot support and an increased rocker to give you a more stable platform underfoot and smoother transitions from heel to toe.

Cushioning: high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. New-and-improved foam on the midsole provides a soft and comfortable feel as you log your miles. High foam stacks help keep you comfortable. Shaped like a rocker, the foam provides support for the 3 phases of a runner's stride. It offers flexibility when your foot rises off the ground, a smooth ride when your foot is moving forwards and cushioning at ground contact.

Responsiveness: minimum
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. A Zoom Air unit in the forefoot offers responsive cushioning. Every step helps create energy return to help drive you forwards with a springy, responsive sensation.

Accommodating fit
The accommodating forefoot allows you plenty of space to spread out your toes. The wider forefoot complements a wider base and smooth ride. Added structure and containment around the heel provides a more supportive fit.

What's new about the Structure 25?
We added even more foam than our previous Structures, with better support and comfort than its predecessor as well. The new-and-improved foam underfoot helps give you support.

Catch 'em if you can. Giving you race-day speed to conquer any distance, the Nike Vaporfly 3 is made for the chasers, the racers and the elevated pacers who can't turn down the thrill of the pursuit. We reworked the leader of the super shoe pack and tuned the engine underneath to help you chase personal bests from a 10K to marathon. From elite runners to those new to racing, this versatile road-racing workhorse is for those who see speed as a gateway to more miles and more seemingly uncatchable highs.

Propelling You Forwards

Speed for Miles
Nike ZoomX, our most responsive foam, just got a little better. Running from heel to toe, it unlocks even more energy return than before, giving you a springy, bouncy feel.

Stable Ride
See how the midsole bulges out by the heel? We designed it that way to help reduce weight on the inside of the foot to give you a more stable ride.

Feel the Breeze
Specifically selected Flyknit yarns and engineered zones in the forefoot bring a new level of performance to the Vaporfly. Ample breathability around the toes combined with soft, yet supportive yarns deliver our most customised upper for the Vaporfly. The result is a softer, cooler design that contours to your foot.

What's New About the Vaporfly 3?
An updated thin outsole rubber uses less material without sacrificing durability, which helps reduce outsole weight and thickness. This allows for extra millimetres of ZoomX foam underfoot and a smoother transition through your stride.

Upper is strategically zoned to hug the foot for containment and stability during quick, active movements.
Lightweight foam in the midsole went through a finer grinding process for a softer, more comfortable feel for everyday wear.
Flex grooves on the sole let your foot bend naturally.
Rubber on the outsole is strategically placed in the toe tip, forefoot and heel to address the high-wear areas and enhance the overall durability and traction.","WREAK HAVOC ON YOUR WORKOUT, NOT THE PLANET.

The new Nike SuperRep Go 3 Flyknit Shoe is a radical design story rooted in sustainability and innovation. The zoned Flyknit construction wraps your foot in 360 degrees of comfort and support. A finely ground, reclaimed foam midsole gives you responsive cushioning for high-impact training. The lightweight, packable design lets you keep them close, no matter where your next workout takes you.

Mindful Design
Made from recycled materials to lessen the impact on our planet, it features a stretchy zonal Flyknit upper construction that is made from recycled fibres and is strategically zoned for added containment during movement. Modified Crater Foam with Nike Grind material was used in the midsole for improved comfort, stability and durability.

Packable. Lightweight. Durable.
Designed with versatility in mind, the lightweight modifications to the upper, midsole and outsole give you a flexible shoe made for more than just your next HIIT class. Equipped to tackle your most challenging plyometrics, yet comfortable enough to wear around town. When it's not on your foot, you'll want to keep this shoe close. The lightweight packability of the new design makes that easy.

Less Shoe, More You
In an effort to minimise waste through an efficient method of construction, Nike designers cored out portions of the midsole, resulting in a lighter feel. The rubber on the outsole is placed in high-wear areas only—achieving an efficient design that gives you everything you need and nothing you don't.

A balanced ride to help kick-start your run, the Winflo 10 is great whether you're a creature of habit logging your weekly mileage, a rookie hoping to turn intrigue into routine or just joining a friend for a spontaneous weekend run. A neutral support shoe with springy Nike Air, plus more space in the forefoot, leads to a comfortable, bouncy feel. It's ready-made for your run, whenever the road is calling your name.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Winflo 10 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Full-length Nike Air cushioning gives you a soft, comfortable feel for your miles.

Responsiveness: Medium
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. Soft foam in the midsole works with the Nike Air cushioning to give you a bouncy, springy feel.

What's New About the Winflo 10?
A revamped toe box provides a better fit for all foot types compared to the Winflo 9. Plus, we increased the collar comfort and fit, with padding where it counts most.

On the 10th anniversary of possibly the most popular Tiger Woods shoe ever, we're re-releasing the iconic design as our 1st true Tiger retro, an ahead-of-its-time game-changer. It offers the unique fit and feel of Nike Free technology for all-round comfort and roaring post-putt fist pumps. The outsole helps keep you steady, so you can channel your Tiger-esque club twirls after ripping a massive tee shot down the middle of the fairway.

Behind the Design
The inspiration behind the Nike TW '13 began with Tiger himself. An avid enthusiast of Nike Free shoes away from the links, he asked for a golf shoe that gave him the same fit and feel as the shoes that he ran, lifted and trained in. The result was a combination of comfort and performance that changed golf shoes as we know them.

Swing Through
The engineered outsole mimics and conforms to the natural motion of the foot, coupled with the traction of a lightweight performance golf shoe. This innovative outsole helps you to keep contact with the ground longer, better harnessing the energy of the foot to the shoe and, therefore, the shoe to the ground.

Fitted Feel
Nike's Dynamic Fit system offers targeted support, delivering strength-to-weight ratio and 1-to-1 fitted support. Flywire-infused nylon straps extend 360 degrees from the footbed to the lacing system, securing the foot for an adaptive fit that provides golfers stability with mobility.

Tour-Level Traction
Updated removable spikes and spike receptacles provide exceptional grip.",0.0

A new shoe with old-school appeal—your retro dreams just came true. This pared-back design references the classic AF-1, then leans into '80s style with throwback stitching and varsity-inspired colours. Not everything has to be a throwback, though—modern comfort and durability make them easy to wear any time, anywhere. Time to throw them on and go full force.

Welcome home. From first look to first step, the ISPA MindBody is the new definition of R&R. The inviting and pillowy foam midsole is an oasis of sensations, while its light and airy Flyknit upper provides a sanctuary you won't want to step away from. Guided by Nike's circular design philosophy, a key feature to this concept is designing with product end of life in mind, which resulted in shoes that can be easily disassembled. No glue necessary—just a single cording system that holds it all together. When you're done with your shoes, there's no need to take them apart or throw them away. Simply drop 'em off at a participating Nike store and they'll be given a new life through donation or recycling.

Benefits
Guided by Nike's circular design philosophy, each pair is constructed with interlocking components and the intent of using fewer materials.
Stretchy and supportive, Flyknit upper is made from recycled yarn for a seamless look that feels as light as air.
In place of a sockliner, you'll find lofted Flyknit underfoot for a brand-new sensation.
Toggle system lets you easily adjust your fit.

What is ISPA?
Nike ISPA: a philosophy entwining the concepts of improvise, scavenge, protect and adapt to create space for those who are seeking deeper meaning and connection to the products they use. From sustainability to manufacturing processes and all the way to the comfort of your foot, every detail matters. The MindBody design is guided by these principles, using product disassembly and proprioception (the awareness of how your body moves throughout space and interacts with your environment) to take you into the next evolution of footwear design.",4.2

When everyday runs are on the menu, the Nike Renew Ride 3 comes through with a smooth and soft ride. It's got a secure fit and a cosy feel, geared for those looking to find their running potential. The upper is clean and fresh, with touch points throughout for easy on and off. It's so comfortable, you'll want to keep wearing it after your run.

Comfort Fit
A cushioned collar delivers a soft feel and look. The collar and tongue are designed with intuitive touch points for easy on and off. Combined with the breathable feel of the upper, the shoe delivers a secure fit like a hug for your foot.

Soft Ride
Our Renew foam is softer than previous versions, helping provide impact absorption as your foot hits the ground. The Renew foam is wrapped around the heel, creating a secure clip for your foot. We added more foam for a smoother transition from heel to toe, resulting in an extra spring to your step.

Your workhorse with wings returns to help you push through the rain. A water-repellent finish helps keep you dry while a cosy fleece-like feel on the inside helps keep your feet warm for nasty-weather runs. Rugged traction and 2 Zoom Air units provide grip and soft cushioning, so you can power through the elements.

Warmth for Your Feet
Like a warm jacket for your feet, knit material in the upper helps keep your feet warm. Skins placed around the toes—in areas where water can seep in—help to keep you dry. Insulation on the back of the tongue helps your feet stay warm and comfortable.

Dry Design
A water-repellent finish and gusseted tongue work together to help keep your feet dry. Heathered lining in the collar helps keep your ankle warm and dry.

Rain-Ready Traction
The Storm-tread outsole provides traction in inclement weather. It has textures inspired by winter tyres. Micro grooves grab the road, while multi-directional shapes help shed water for direct contact with the tarmac.

Smooth Transition
Nike React technology is a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a smooth, responsive ride. We paired it with 2 Zoom Air units (at the forefoot and heel) for an energised feel at toe-off. The result is a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Lightweight, Breathable and Durable
Durable, reinforced mesh helps keep your feet cool and adds extra support.

More Benefits
Stretchy internal sleeve hugs your foot for a sock-like fit.

When approaching rocky and technical terrain, go with the comfort and speed of the Kiger 9, there for every unexpected twist and tight turn. Equipped with full-length Nike React foam and a revamped breathable upper, this agile, quick trainer helps keep you zigzagging in and out of trails with speed. It's lower to the ground and lighter than our previous iteration, so that you can handle the off-road path with pace and security.

Smooth and Springy
Nike React technology is a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a smooth, responsive ride. We implemented a full React midsole and removed the forefoot Air unit from the prior iteration, so that you can get even closer to the ground without sacrificing comfort and speed.

Feel the Connection
Multi-directional traction lugs in the heel have high-abrasion rubber to help give you enhanced grip on ascents and descents, even in wet weather, so you can stay connected to the trail.

Revamped Upper
The upper is light and reductive, so the shoe feels like it disappears on your feet while still offering cushioning on the trails. It's made from engineered mesh, stronger and more flexible than normal mesh, and helps keep dirt out. The midfoot band provides stability and support to help minimise movement inside the shoe.

Optimised Durability
Hard-wearing, abrasion-resistant materials help provide durability in key areas, like the overlays around the toe and the rubber outsole wrap on the heel and forefoot.

With supportive cushioning built for a smooth run, the Nike InfinityRN 4 is a brand-new take on a familiar favourite. It's made from our all-new Nike ReactX foam, which gives you 13% more energy return compared to Nike React foam, to help you stay fresh and bouncy. (What's more? Nike ReactX reduces its carbon footprint in a pair of midsoles by at least 43% compared with Nike React foam.*) This version has GORE-TEX fabric to help you stay dry for your miles. It's the kind of shoe that supports every step in style. *The carbon footprint of ReactX is based on a cradle-to-gate assessment reviewed by PRé Sustainability B.V. and Intertek China. Other midsole components such as airbags, plates or other foam formulations were not considered.

What's new about the Nike InfinityRN 4?
This version of the Nike InfinityRN 4 still provides a plush and smooth ride, with ReactX foam delivering more support. The wider toe box helps your foot feel stable and secure.

Dry Design
Waterproof GORE-TEX fabric helps keep you dry so you can focus on the adventure.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. ReactX foam gives you an incredibly smooth feeling, helping you push your limits.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. A curved outsole helps your foot rock smoothly from heel to toe and through your stride to footstrike. It makes every step feel more natural and adds efficiency to your run, helping you waste less energy as you hit your stride.

Responsiveness: moderate
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. ReactX foam gives you +13% energy return compared with React foam, helping you stay fresh and bouncy during your run.

Reliable Traction
A Storm Tread outsole provides reliable traction on wet and slippery surfaces. The rubber wraps around the front of the shoe for extra durability. Its generative traction pattern combined with rubber lugs gives you grip when going uphill or downhill.

More benefits
A water-repellent liner in the toe helps keep you dry when the weather turns.
Foam collar is soft and supportive to the touch.
Increased rubber at the outsole gives traction and durability.

In other words—it's going to feel good all day, whatever you're doing. And when you pair all this cushioning with easy-to-style colours, you get a shoe you never want to stop wearing.

Support: high
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Invincible 3 has high-support technology, with cushioning and stability intentionally placed and shaped to help protect your foot from the effects of pronation.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. With Nike ZoomX cushioning shaped like a rocker and higher foam heights, this shoe is so soft and bouncy that just by putting it on you'll be excited for your next run. It provides ultimate cushioning on ground contact and an even softer underfoot feel for your workout and beyond.

Responsiveness: super-high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. Nike ZoomX foam is ultra-responsive and lightweight, giving you bounce and a snappy response with every step.

Fit: secure, breathable, comfortable
An evolved Flyknit upper places zones of breathability where your foot heats up most. It's strong and durable, helping keep your foot secure with every mile.

What's new about the Invincible 3?
A wider midsole adds more stability than our previous iteration. Taller foam stacks than our previous version raise the bar on cushioning and comfort, in a more sleek-looking design. The strong plastic going around the heel is smaller than our previous iteration while still providing a secure, comfortable fit.

The updated midsole has taller foam for a softer feel. Underfoot coring helps give you a more consistent ride. Overlays throughout the upper add durability.

Extra Comfort
The collar and tongue are soft to the touch for added cushioning. The collar is wider to comfortably fit around the shape of your ankle.

Durability and Stability
Rubber at the heel provides durability while a moulded heel clip helps keep your foot secure and stable.

29.0,,"Tongue is separated from the upper to give room for different foot shapes.
We tuned the shoe for your foot, giving you a softer, more plush feel.","ENERGISED FOR MILES.

Let the Nike Pegasus FlyEase, a balanced and energised ride for any run, help you ascend to new heights. A supportive sensation helps keep your foot contained, while underfoot Air adds a pop to your step as you transition from heel to toe. Nike FlyEase technology acts as a strap, helping secure the fit. Your trusted workhorse with wings is back. Time to fly.

Strap In and Go
A FlyEase strap over the upper lets you easily slip in and out of the shoe. Use the strap to help secure the fit.

Total Comfort
We tested runners like you to find where your foot needed cooling the most. Using that data, we placed engineered mesh—stronger and more flexible than regular mesh—throughout the upper for lightweight and breathable durability. Extra padding in the tongue and collar helps keep your foot feeling comfortable.

Supportive Steps
Flywire technology is integrated with a midfoot band for total support that helps keep your foot in place.

Snap, Run and Pop
Nike React technology is a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a smooth, responsive ride. We paired it with a Zoom Air unit at the forefoot and heel for an energised feel at toe-off. The result is a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Smooth, Durable Transitions
A rubber outsole with a Waffle-inspired pattern provides traction. Flex grooves throughout give you extra flexibility and a smooth feel on toe-off. We designed the heel to optimise your landing, helping you easily transition from heel to toe.

Nike Dunk
From backboards to skateboards, the influence of the Nike Dunk is undeniable. Although introduced as a basketball shoe in 1985, its flat and grippy soles were perfect for a neglected sports community—skaters. Uncovering a subculture craving creativity as much as function, the Dunk released decades of countless colourways that continue to capture the soul of skaters from coast to coast.",4.8

We looked into the future and it's gonna be comfy. Featuring a ""point-loaded"" Air unit (cushioning that forms to your every step), the Air Max Scorpion Flyknit delivers a futuristic sensation. And because looks count, we've crafted the upper from incredibly soft chenille-like fabric.

The Future of Comfort
Built around the concept of ""point-loading"" (designer jargon that simply means great responsiveness and improved comfort), the Air cushioning works in tandem with other components to deliver a new underfoot sensation.

Responsible Style
The expressive upper pairs super-soft chenille-style fabric with incredibly lightweight Flyknit, striking a balance between fashion and sport. To top it off, we've made it from at least 20% recycled material by weight so you can look good while doing good.

Traction to Get You Places
A generative design pattern on the outsole improves traction on a variety of surfaces so you can focus on your journey.

The Nike MC Trainer 2 can help you shift from circuit training in the weight room to the Astroturf for quick-twitch conditioning, seamlessly. It's a multi-purpose power that combines versatility, stability and longevity so that you can stay locked in on the physical task at hand. From back squats to sprint repeats, it can help support the rigours of your diverse training programme without having to make a pit stop to grab more gear for your workout.

Stable Strength
The flat base is wider around the heel to help stabilise your foot while you work with weights. Overlays around the toe and laces add durability to stand up to the rigours of the gym.

Move It from Side to Side
Support wraps from the heel up to the sides for a snug fit when you tighten the laces. Soft foam provides supportive cushioning and rises at the sides to help brace your foot during lateral moves.

Thick and Thin Traction
Rubber tread gives you traction from the turf to the training room floor. It's thicker under the heel for stability while you lift, and thinner in the front for flexibility during short runs or speed drills.

The Nike MC Trainer 2 can help you shift from circuit training in the weight room to the Astroturf for quick-twitch conditioning, seamlessly. It's a multi-purpose power that combines versatility, stability and longevity so that you can stay locked in on the physical task at hand. From back squats to sprint repeats, it can help support the rigours of your diverse training programme without having to make a pit stop to grab more gear for your workout.

Stable Strength
The flat base is wider around the heel to help stabilise your foot while you work with weights. Overlays around the toe and laces add durability to stand up to the rigours of the gym.

Move It from Side to Side
Support wraps from the heel up to the sides for a snug fit when you tighten the laces. Soft foam provides supportive cushioning and rises at the sides to help brace your foot during lateral moves.

Thick and Thin Traction
Rubber tread gives you traction from the turf to the training room floor. It's thicker under the heel for stability while you lift, and thinner in the front for flexibility during short runs or speed drills.

In other words—it's going to feel good all day, whatever you're doing. It has everything you need so you can propel down your preferred path and come back for your next run feeling ready and reinvigorated.

Support: high

The Invincible 3 has high-support technology, with cushion and stability intentionally placed and shaped to protect your foot from the effects of pronation.

Cushioning: super-high

With Nike ZoomX cushioning shaped like a rocker and higher foam heights, this shoe is so soft and bouncy that just by putting it on you'll be excited for your next run. It gives you ultimate cushioning on ground contact and an even softer underfoot feel for your workout and beyond.

Responsiveness: super-high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. Nike ZoomX foam is ultra-responsive and lightweight, giving you bounce and a snappy response with every step.

Fit: secure, breathable, comfortable

Nike Air Max Origins
Revolutionary Air technology first made its way into Nike footwear in 1978. In 1987, the Air Max 1 debuted with visible Air technology in its heel, allowing fans more than just the feel of Air cushioning—suddenly they could see it. Since then, next-generation Air Max shoes have become a hit with athletes and collectors by offering striking colour combinations and reliable, lightweight cushioning.",4.5

When approaching rocky and technical terrain, go with the comfort and speed of the Kiger 9, there for every unexpected twist and tight turn. Equipped with full-length Nike React foam and a revamped breathable upper, this agile, quick trainer helps keep you zigzagging in and out of trails with speed. It's lower to the ground and lighter than our previous iteration, so that you can handle the off-road path with pace and security.

Smooth and Springy
Nike React technology is a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a smooth, responsive ride. We implemented a full React midsole and removed the forefoot Air unit from the prior iteration, so that you can get even closer to the ground without sacrificing comfort and speed.

Feel the Connection
Multi-directional traction lugs in the heel have high-abrasion rubber to help give you enhanced grip on ascents and descents, even in wet weather, so you can stay connected to the trail.

Revamped Upper
The upper is light and reductive, so the shoe feels like it disappears on your feet while still offering cushioning on the trails. It's made from engineered mesh, stronger and more flexible than normal mesh, and helps keep dirt out. The midfoot band provides stability and support to help minimise movement inside the shoe.

Optimised Durability
Hard-wearing, abrasion-resistant materials help provide durability in key areas, like the overlays around the toe and the rubber outsole wrap on the heel and forefoot.

Feel unbeatable from the tee box to the final putt in a design ithat's pure early MJ: speed, class and laden with true early '90s touches like visible Air and a translucent rubber sole that continue to stand the test of time. This model fuses the strut of 1st MJ's championship with some of our best golf technology, helping you make a statement of confidence when it comes time to tame the course.

AJ 6 Inspiration
MJ's German sports car served as the inspiration for the original shoe's design, with its very essence conveying speed and class. A moulded heel tab is on the back of the sneaker, something Jordan himself required back in '91 so that it wouldn't hit his Achilles tendon when putting on the shoe. Two holes in the tongue are a nod to the original AJ 5.

Inspired by traditional crafting and a desire to reintroduce the human element into shoe construction, Nike and Jacquemus created the J Force 1. Notes were taken from Nike Considered, the early-2000s project known for using minimal glue as a means to lessen the environmental impact of footwear production. All of this hypothetical influence resulted in a shoe that looks equally at home in an art museum as it does in the outside world.

A springy and soft ride to energise every mile, the Vomero 17 takes you to your running happy place. Its stacked foam provides premium responsiveness to help you kick it up a notch when you're ready for that extra gear. And with across-the-board enhancements that deliver a new level of lightweight comfort and breathability, this shoe is for those road runners who seek the thrill of the vroom and the kind of plush feel that puts you in cruise control for short-to-long distances.

Cushioning: super-high
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Packed with our premium ZoomX and Cushlon foams, the Vomero 17 delivers comfort underfoot for a balanced, soft stride. Based on runner feedback, we also removed the forefoot Zoom Air unit in the previous version to simplify the midsole for a more plush feel.

Responsiveness: super-high
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. In the Vomero 17, our maximum spring shoe, your foot sits on a stack of ZoomX—Nike Running's lightest and highest energy-returning foam—on the top and soft foam on the bottom for an energised yet smooth ride.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Vomero 17 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe that helps complement your natural stride.

Fit and Feel
This shoe prides itself on premium comfort that puts you in cruise control for short-to-long miles. The engineered mesh makes for a lighter and more breathable upper compared with previous Vomeros. A plush insole offers comfort upon entry, while a soft collar feels gentle on your heel once it's time to run. The padded tongue and soft, stretchy laces top off an ultra-comfortable overall experience.

What's new about the Vomero 17?
We simplified the build of the 17 by removing the forefoot Zoom Air unit and stacking premium ZoomX foam on top of the midsole to amplify the cushioned comfort. The result is a softer, more responsive ride.

Manifest your mountainous best, when the trail ahead is skiddy and uncertain. Our all-new championship trail racing shoe melds our best speed components from the running world with what you need to plant your flag first at the finishing line. It offers peak performance, sleek speed and endurance for those who want to summit nature's playground.

Trail Speed
For the first time in Nike Trail Running, we implemented a carbon Flyplate, layered between ZoomX foam and a knit fabric-wrapped midsole, to give you propulsive energy and a springy feel. It helps you stay fresh to continue pushing the limits of speed, whether you're at mile 1 or mile 50.

Traction for Various Conditions
Slimmer and lighter than a traditional outsole, the Vibram outsole has a sticky rubber that works with a chevron lug pattern to provide grip on both uphill climbs and downhill descents, even in wet weather.

Stable on the Trail
A flat bottom and minimised cross rocker give you optimal stability on trail terrain while the heel-to-toe rocker provides a smooth transition. Specifically engineered zones of support in the midfoot give you a secure yet lightweight feel, while weaving through the trail at a rapid pace.

Durability Where You Need It
The fabric wrap on the midsole helps to cushion the foam from the elements and abrasion of being on the trails. Hard-wearing abrasion-resistant materials provide durability.

More benefits
Vaporweave mesh on the upper provides breathability.
Foam midsole adds cushioning.

Air Max 1
Sure, Air Max 1 started as a running shoe, but you can't keep innovation contained.

A balanced ride to help kick-start your run, the Winflo 10 is great whether you're a creature of habit logging your weekly mileage, a rookie hoping to turn intrigue into routine or just joining a friend for a spontaneous weekend run. A neutral support shoe with springy Nike Air, plus more space in the forefoot, leads to a comfortable, bouncy feel. It's ready-made for your run, whenever the road is calling your name.

Support: neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Winflo 10 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too.

Cushioning: medium
The more cushioning you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Full-length Nike Air cushioning gives you a soft, comfortable feel for your miles.

Responsiveness: Medium
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. Soft foam in the midsole works with the Nike Air cushioning to give you a bouncy, springy feel.

What's New About the Winflo 10?
A revamped toe box provides a better fit for all foot types compared to the Winflo 9. Plus, we increased the collar comfort and fit, with padding where it counts most.

The speed cage inside the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding additional weight for optimal lockdown.

Dig in, take off
Unique traction pattern offers super-charged traction with quick release to create separation.

Improved fit
A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better lockdown in the heel.

Feel the ball
The upper has NikeSkin, a soft and flexible mesh material linked together by a thin coating. It helps provide ball control and truly gives you a feeling of barefoot football.

You bring the speed. We'll bring the stability. The Luka 2 is built to support your skills, with an emphasis on step-backs, side-steps and quick-stop action. A stacked midsole features firm, flexible cushioning for added responsiveness as you shift back and forth on the court. Up top, the full-foot wrapped cage design helps you stay contained whether you're faking out a defender or driving down the lane. With all that tech in a lightweight package, we've got efficiency covered. The rest is up to you.

Cushioned for Impact
When you're shifting side to side, you need support that's firm—but not rigid. A wedge of cushioning in the midsole butts up against the medial sidewall so you can bank like a champ, and a thick, moulded insole helps you stay grounded.

Last-Step Efficiency
The other aspect of side-to-side movement? Lateral support. To help your quick stops feel secure, we added a strong, flexible plate that runs up the lateral side wall, complemented by a firm foam carrier and Formula 23 foam in the midsole.

360 Degrees of Support
A sturdy cage wraps around the entire upper for 360-degree connected support that help your feet stay securely contained, whichever way you step—or however quick you stop.

Instantly tilt the pitch in the bold design of the Superfly 9 Academy MG. It's loaded with a Zoom Air unit and flexible NikeSkin at the top for exceptional touch, so you can dominate in the waning minutes of a match—when it matters most. Fast is in the Air.

Welcome to the pitch, Zoom
For the first time in our history, Nike has developed an all-new Zoom Air unit. It sits in the plate and provides an additional level of springy underfoot feel that helps you move faster on the pitch and create separation when it matters the most—whether you're scoring goals, being first to the ball or going by defenders.

Drive your speed
The speed cage inside the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding additional weight for optimal lockdown.

Dig in, take off
Unique traction pattern offers super-charged traction with quick release to create separation.

Improved fit
Flyknit wraps your ankle in soft, stretchy fabric for a secure feel. A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better lockdown in the heel.

Barefoot feel
The upper has NikeSkin, a soft and flexible mesh material linked together by a thin coating. It helps provide ball control and truly gives you a feeling of barefoot football.

Nike Air Max Origins

Who doesn't love a party? The core of this AJXXXVIII colourway comes from Chicago's 1993 championship kit. Sprinkle in some Gold and plenty of game-ready tech, and you've got a winner. Grab your goggles, pop some bottles and join the celebration.

Court mobility
Quick cuts, speedy sprints and all-over court control—that's what you want. It's the low-to-the-court Zoom Strobel Air unit that helps you achieve it.

Strength + security
The embroidery in the upper is designed to help you feel extra secure while criss-crossing the court. Your skills, plus supportive, lightweight mesh? A winning combo.

Heritage details
Baked right into the shoe's design are shout-outs to MJ's legendary '93 season. Cross-hatches, chevrons and lines of ribbing on one shoe represent his points, assists and rebounds per game. Fabric details on the other nod to the 57-25 season record—and MJ's third consecutive championship.

The pitch is yours when you lace up in the Vapor 15 Academy MG. It's loaded with a Zoom Air unit and flexible NikeSkin at the top for exceptional touch, so you can dominate in the waning minutes of a match—when it matters most. Fast is in the Air.

Welcome to the pitch, Zoom
For the first time in our history, Nike has developed an all-new Zoom Air unit. It sits in the plate and provides an additional level of springy underfoot feel that helps you move faster on the pitch and create separation when it matters the most—whether you're scoring goals, being first to the ball or going by defenders.

Drive your speed
The speed cage inside the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding additional weight for optimal lockdown.

Dig in, take off
Unique traction pattern offers super-charged traction with quick release to create separation.

Improved fit
A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better lockdown in the heel.

Feel the ball
The upper has NikeSkin, a soft and flexible mesh material linked together by a thin coating. It helps provide ball control and truly gives you a feeling of barefoot football.

You bring the speed. We'll bring the stability. The Luka 2 is built to support your skills, with an emphasis on step-backs, side-steps and quick-stop action. A stacked midsole features firm, flexible cushioning for added responsiveness as you shift back and forth on the court. Up top, the full-foot wrapped cage design helps you stay contained whether you're faking out a defender or driving down the lane. With all that tech in a lightweight package, we've got efficiency covered. The rest is up to you.

Cushioned for Impact
When you're shifting side to side, you need support that's firm—but not rigid. A wedge of cushioning in the midsole butts up against the medial sidewall so you can bank like a champ, and a thick, moulded insole helps you stay grounded.

Last-Step Efficiency
The other aspect of side-to-side movement? Lateral support. To help your quick stops feel secure, we added a strong, flexible plate that runs up the lateral side wall, complemented by a firm foam carrier and Formula 23 foam in the midsole.

360 Degrees of Support
A sturdy cage wraps around the entire upper for 360-degree connected support that help your feet stay securely contained, whichever way you step—or however quick you stop.

Instantly tilt the pitch in the bold design of the Superfly 9 Academy MG. It's loaded with a Zoom Air unit and flexible NikeSkin at the top for exceptional touch, so you can dominate in the waning minutes of a match—when it matters most. Fast is in the Air.

Welcome to the pitch, Zoom
For the first time in our history, Nike has developed an all-new Zoom Air unit. It sits in the plate and provides an additional level of springy underfoot feel that helps you move faster on the pitch and create separation when it matters the most—whether you're scoring goals, being first to the ball or going by defenders.

Drive your speed
The speed cage inside the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding additional weight for optimal lockdown.

Dig in, take off
Unique traction pattern offers super-charged traction with quick release to create separation.

Improved fit
Flyknit wraps your ankle in soft, stretchy fabric for a secure feel. A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better lockdown in the heel.

Barefoot feel
The upper has NikeSkin, a soft and flexible mesh material linked together by a thin coating. It helps provide ball control and truly gives you a feeling of barefoot football.

The pitch is yours when you lace up in the Vapor 15 Academy MG. It's loaded with a Zoom Air unit and flexible NikeSkin at the top for exceptional touch, so you can dominate in the waning minutes of a match—when it matters most. Fast is in the Air.

Welcome to the pitch, Zoom
For the first time in our history, Nike has developed an all-new Zoom Air unit. It sits in the plate and provides an additional level of springy underfoot feel that helps you move faster on the pitch and create separation when it matters the most—whether you're scoring goals, being first to the ball or going by defenders.

Drive your speed
The speed cage inside the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding additional weight for optimal lockdown.

Dig in, take off
Unique traction pattern offers super-charged traction with quick release to create separation.

Improved fit
A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better lockdown in the heel.

Feel the ball
The upper has NikeSkin, a soft and flexible mesh material linked together by a thin coating. It helps provide ball control and truly gives you a feeling of barefoot football.

You bring the speed. We'll bring the stability. The Luka 2 is built to support your skills, with an emphasis on step-backs, side-steps and quick-stop action. A stacked midsole features firm, flexible cushioning for added responsiveness as you shift back and forth on the court. Up top, the full-foot wrapped cage design helps you stay contained whether you're faking out a defender or driving down the lane. With all that tech in a lightweight package, we've got efficiency covered. The rest is up to you.

Cushioned for Impact
When you're shifting side to side, you need support that's firm—but not rigid. A wedge of cushioning in the midsole butts up against the medial sidewall so you can bank like a champ, and a thick, moulded insole helps you stay grounded.

Last-Step Efficiency
The other aspect of side-to-side movement? Lateral support. To help your quick stops feel secure, we added a strong, flexible plate that runs up the lateral side wall, complemented by a firm foam carrier and Formula 23 foam in the midsole.

360 Degrees of Support
A sturdy cage wraps around the entire upper for 360-degree connected support that help your feet stay securely contained, whichever way you step—or however quick you stop.

Instantly tilt the pitch in the bold design of the Superfly 9 Academy MG. It's loaded with a Zoom Air unit and flexible NikeSkin at the top for exceptional touch, so you can dominate in the waning minutes of a match—when it matters most. Fast is in the Air.

Welcome to the pitch, Zoom
For the first time in our history, Nike has developed an all-new Zoom Air unit. It sits in the plate and provides an additional level of springy underfoot feel that helps you move faster on the pitch and create separation when it matters the most—whether you're scoring goals, being first to the ball or going by defenders.

Drive your speed
The speed cage inside the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding additional weight for optimal lockdown.

Dig in, take off
Unique traction pattern offers super-charged traction with quick release to create separation.

Improved fit
Flyknit wraps your ankle in soft, stretchy fabric for a secure feel. A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better lockdown in the heel.

Barefoot feel
The upper has NikeSkin, a soft and flexible mesh material linked together by a thin coating. It helps provide ball control and truly gives you a feeling of barefoot football.

Your miles are your getaway, the moments of calm from your busy day. Let the Nike Escape Run 2 help you find your serenity with its breathable design and midfoot support. It's soft underfoot, with the traction you need to get around city streets. It's made for your daily runs and beyond—with a plush sensation that keeps you comfortable from workout to hangout.

Stretch and Breathe
Plush, breathable materials throughout the upper have a comfortable feel. The fabric has a little more give than the original Escape Run, giving you a better fit at the toes.

The Right Fit
We made the collar wider to accommodate your ankle. A soft foam lines the area, giving you plush, stable support.

High Stacks, Soft Steps
Soft is key. The midsole uses lightweight Nike React foam for a responsive, durable ride. Higher foam heights give a smooth sensation for comfort with every step.

Supportive Turns
Support through the heel helps keep your foot feeling secure while running over kerbs or turning on city streets.

Run the Town
This shoe is ideal for running in the city. Multi-directional traction helps provide stability for any surprises you may encounter on your route. The tough rubber outsole was built for the rigours of the pavement.

Lace Up and Go
Embroidered elements create a premium construction that's made for your entire day—from work to workouts. Touch points at the collar and the tongue provide a familiar feel as you slide your foot into the shoe.

A springy ride for any run, the Peg's familiar, just-for-you feel returns to help you accomplish your goals. This version has the same responsiveness and neutral support you love but with improved comfort in those sensitive areas of your foot, like the arch and toes. Whether you're logging long marathon miles, squeezing in a speed session before the sun goes down or hopping into a spontaneous group jaunt, it's still the established road runner you can put your faith in, day after day, run after run. This design celebrates the Pegasus' history with Swoosh logos from the Peg 1, 24, 35 and 38.

Support: Neutral
The more supportive the shoe, the more stability it can give to your natural stride. A combination of tuned support and intentionally placed cushioning helps you feel secure with every step. The Peg 40 has neutral support. It gives you balance, whether you're a heel or a forefoot striker. It's good for long and short runs, too, providing a smooth transition from heel to toe.

Cushioning: Medium
The more cushioning that you have underfoot, the softer and more comfortable your running experience can be. Cushioning helps soften the impact as your feet hit the ground. Feel connected to the ground with Nike React technology: a lightweight, durable foam that delivers a comfortable, responsive ride. It holds its shape run after run to give you a consistent feeling.

Responsiveness: High
The more responsive the shoe, the more energy return you can get back with each step. Whether you want to run a little bit faster or with a little less effort, responsive shoes help give you slightly more spring in your step to get more out of your run. We paired Nike React technology with 2 Zoom Air units (1 in the forefoot and the heel) to give you a bouncy, springy sensation and an energised feel at toe-off.

Inviting Fit and Feel
A highly tuned single-layer mesh creates an inviting feel and fit. We redesigned the midfoot strap for a more moulded fit to the foot, shaped for all sized arches.

What's New About the Peg 40?
When we sat down to design the Peg 40, we took an inside-out approach, literally, starting with an implemented midfoot band for a more secure, but forgiving sensation, like the Peg is giving your arch a welcoming, gentle hug. We wanted to make the inner confines of the shoe comfortable, breathable and forgiving in the toes, arch and heel, where your feet are most sensitive, with an engineered circular pattern that allows it to adapt to your foot. Suede material allows it to provide better fit without irritation, from your 1st run to your last run.

Waffle-inspired pattern provides traction for the road.

We added extra support along the sides via a band at the midfoot. It works with your laces, helping you adjust how snug and secure your foot feels. There's also a clip at the heel, helping with stability as you run across uneven surfaces.

Cool For the Distance
We tested real runners to learn where feet need the most cooling. Using that data, we put mesh in key spots (especially around the toes) to give you stretch and ventilation.

Snappy Steps
Your foot sits on Nike ZoomX, our lightest and highest energy returning foam. It gives you a smooth ride from foot strike through your transition. We combined it with Zoom Air cushioning under the forefoot for a snappy, responsive feel as you push off.

More Benefits
High-abrasion rubber at the outsole with lugs gives you durable traction.
The tongue is even more plush than previous versions.

Sabrina Ionescu's game is unique, hard to define and built with an undeniable craft. Her signature shoe helps you unlock your versatility with a snappy forefoot Zoom Air unit and cloud-like React foam to help keep you energised.

Feel the hardwood under your feet as you change direction in an instant. With its extra-durable rubber outsole, this version gives you traction for outdoor courts.

Stay Fresh
We've paired a top-loaded forefoot Zoom Air unit with a full-length React foam core to deliver the ideal balance of stability, ground control and cushioning.

Play with Confidence
We teamed the collar with a midfoot band system that allows conformability and adjustability around the arch of your foot, all in the name of unlocking quick play and inspiring confidence on the court.

Security Up Top
The collar offers optimal support with minimalism, giving you the support you need, without any unnecessary weight.

Kevin Durant is a true hooper. He'd be just as happy playing casual all afternoon as he would be dropping 40-pieces in the playoffs.

How high do you want to fly? Get off the ground quicker in a design that helps you hover and hold your own in the air when the action goes vertical. If you're a shooter trying to add lift to your jump, a skyscraper hoping to float among the stars or a ground-bound beast trying to beat your opponent to that rebound off the rim, this shoe can add an element of explosiveness to your game. The bounce is unlike anything you've felt before and the landing is cushioned, helping you spring back skywards once you hit the ground. With its extra-durable rubber outsole, this version gives you traction for outdoor courts.

Ready for Take-off
Three doses of Zoom Air (bottom layer of the upper and 2 forefoot units) give you more bounce off the floor. It is combined with the jump plate, wrapped with rubber for added support and durability, for an extra spring.

Land Softly
Nike React foam in the heel offers cushioning and comfort when landing suddenly and powerfully. The moulded heel has an engineered curve for energy absorption and support. The iconic heel and collar design provide lightweight containment and manage micro-movements of the foot.

Lightweight Design
The exoskeleton look and feel uses negative space to make the shoe lightweight.

Pick Your Direction
The herringbone traction uses data-informed design to create grip on the court. Linear and lateral lines provide multi-directional grip that helps reduce slipping and sliding.

In today's game, slow-footed slugs get sought out and exposed. Space makers stay on the floor. The GT Cut 2 EP helps you stop in an instant and accelerate back into the open lane in a low-to-the-ground design that helps minimise court contact while switching direction. We used insights from female athletes to create a shoe that helps you play quickly and with confidence—which every basketball player needs. Separate the players from the playmakers in a design that's built on creating separation but supportive enough to help you play all day. With its extra-durable rubber outsole, this version gives you traction for outdoor courts.

Enhance Your 1st Step
Nike React technology paired with Zoom Air on the bottom layer of the upper, stacked with a Zoom Air unit in the heel, helps provide the responsiveness you need to create space and opportunity off the dribble. The React insole provides support and comfort. Soft foam midsole offers comfort and a stable underfoot experience.

Quick-twitch Take-off
The upper is inspired by a butterfly with an inner cage that's built into the lining underneath. It helps reduce the weight of the shoe to help you take off in an instant.

Hit the Brakes
As you're hitting that sharp cut, the advanced traction helps you briefly stick to the ground while the other directional traction helps you dig your toe in and toe out of it. The hollow herringbone pattern helps you stop quicker.

Last time around, LeBron flipped the script on his shoe game as only the King can. The encore is even better. The LeBron XXI has a cabling system that works with Zoom Air cushioning and a light, low-to-the-ground design, giving you agile fluidity and explosiveness without excess weight. Created for your ascent and the next generation of hoopers, it's ideal for Bron-like open-floor attacks and rising towards the rim when the game's pace turns up. This special design celebrates the akoya pearl, with its perfect shapes and reflective nature. Its natural beauty and grace hold up across any era. With its extra-durable rubber outsole, this version gives you traction for outdoor courts.

Daughter-driven
LeBron is the shield for his daughter, who helped the King grow as a man and softened him as a Dad. He feels the need to protect her always, the same way an oyster shelters a pearl to reach its full potential. Exposed construction on the side of the heel gives a shell-like appearance. The perforated foam tongue is quilted, also imitating a shell's appearance and providing a plush feel.

Akoya excellence
The Burnt Orange accent around the Swoosh design nods to the hair on the oyster shell that supports the akoya and creates the pearl. The leather exterior speaks to the akoya's classic charm.

Cloaked and contained
We reinforced the lightweight mesh with a 360-degree zonal cabling system for optimal containment. We disguised it all with a premium, lightweight drapery for a cloaked finishing touch.

Soften the rise
A Zoom Air unit in the heel and forefoot supports landing and gives you a propulsive feeling. We paired them with a soft, springy foam to help ensure a pillowy feel.

Stay refreshed
Dimensional mesh on the upper is durable and contained. Using lightweight materials, we striated the upper's venting to look like the veining of a shell, helping contain you during explosive movements. Zonal perforations in the sandwich mesh and ventilation on both sides provide breathability.

Your love for the game never fades. That's why the Tatum 1 was created with longevity in mind. Designed to carry you from the first to the fourth (and whatever OT comes up) as efficiently as possible, we stripped it down to the essentials—and made those essentials really, really good. The result is this season's lightest performance basketball shoe, with rubber only where it counts, a stress-tested foam midsole and an uncaged Nike Zoom Air unit for those explosive ups. Whatever stage of ball you're at, the Tatum 1 will keep you playing.

Rubber (Only) Where It Counts
Rubber is heavy, so we did away with as much as possible. But we kept it where it matters most: the forefoot and toe, where you push forwards for big drives.

Reinforced Foam
We wrapped foam around a strong plastic frame in the midsole for lightweight structure. Then, we stress-tested it to make sure it holds up for the full 48.

Minimalist Support
Lightweight mesh in the upper is strong, breathable and helps you feel supported for the whole game (and the next game, and the next …).

Uncaged Air
A Nike Zoom Air unit (visible from the bottom of the shoe) helps get you the ups you're looking for without weighing you down.

We added extra lace holes on the medial midfoot to give you the extra security you need for all-important arch support.

More Benefits
Structured mesh in the upper feels plush around your foot. It fits snugly to help reduce in-shoe movement during play.
The padded collar is contoured to provide a precise fit and support around your ankle.

Ja Morant became the superstar he is today by repeatedly sinking jumpers on crooked rims, jumping on tractor tyres and dribbling through sun-stained traffic cones in steamy South Carolina summers. The JA 1 is a testament to his rise. With Zoom Air, it supports bunny hops and hyper speed without sacrificing comfort, so you can control your own destiny on the court, Ja-style. This special design pays homage to Ja's motivation—the Morant family and the warm memories they created back in the day in the back garden.

Grind City-Raised
As a kid, Ja loved when his Dad fired up the BBQ and cooked hot dogs, burgers and chicken drumsticks after a young Ja and his friends hooped from sunrise to sunset in the Morant back garden. Family means everything to Ja. They're the fuel to his fire, the drive to get it done on the court. This special design pays homage to those Morant family barbecues and the fond memories they made.

Personal Touch
Ja's signature, logo and jersey number are sketched in his own handwriting.

Prepare for Lift-Off
A forefoot Zoom Air unit helps provide increased responsiveness and vertical acceleration. Plush cushioning provides comfort when you come back to Earth after flying in the clouds.

Stay Supported
A containment system and forefoot strap help keep your ankle and heel stable, so you're in control and always supported whether you're changing direction at high speeds, springing towards the rim or staying in front of shifty ball-handlers on defence.

Behind the Design
When Ja wasn't picked first string at an elite summer camp, that might have been the end of his hoops career. But that's not how this story goes. He kept putting in work in an out-of-the-way gym, grinding in the shadows. All Ja needed was the right person to see his skills. The rest is history. Contrasting colours represent the endless determination and stroke of luck that, combined, led to Ja's big break.

Ja Morant grew up playing ball on a cement court in his back garden. The rain never stopped him from putting in the work. JA 1 'Wet Cement' honours the games played and drills done regardless of the weather. Like every JA 1, this pair is moulded to optimise hang time while helping to maintain stability with firm cushioning. That on-court control is what helps you respond quickly for verticality. With its extra-durable rubber outsole, this version gives you traction for outdoor courts.

Cemented status
Check out the reflective design Swoosh logo, speckled midsole and marble outsole. Each is an ode to Ja's back-garden concrete court. That's where Ja, his dad and other hoopers from Ja's hometown honed their craft, both back in the day and even now when the rising superstar feels like he needs to get back to his roots.

Personal touch
Ja's signature, personal logo and jersey number are sketched in his own handwriting.

Prepare for lift-off
A forefoot Zoom Air unit helps provide increased responsiveness and vertical acceleration. Plush cushioning in the midsole provides comfort when you come back to Earth after flying in the clouds.

Land softly
A containment system and forefoot strap help keep your ankle and heel stable so that you're in control and supported whether you're changing direction at high speeds, springing towards the rim or staying in front of pro ball-handlers on defence.

The longer LeBron's legendary career continues, the more his game needs a design that doesn't weigh him down yet can still control all that sublime power. So, we've created our lightest LeBron model but with the kind of bankable support that can help you stay in front of your opponent with the game on the line. Full-length Max Air cushioning helps you take off and land confidently, while lightweight mesh blends with containment cables to help keep you locked in for four quarters or more. This version is made for outdoor court use with its extra-durable rubber outsole.

Cushioned Comfort
A full-length Max Air unit in a low-profile midsole is combined with a foam wrap-up for support when you're moving in lateral directions. The Air is specifically placed in the forefoot to help reduce weight and increase responsiveness. It helps with impact absorption while supporting the smooth transition from heel to toe. Also, it provides side-to-side stability and helps harness and direct your force.

Reinforced Materials
Breathable mesh provides a lightweight, conforming fit in the upper, from the webbing that harnesses your forefoot to the external moulded pieces that help lock in your heel. Reinforced stitching along the sides helps the shoe fit snugly for full-foot containment.

Aggressive Traction
The rubber outsole is split and partially cut out under the arch to help it bend and flex while helping reduce its overall weight. A classic herringbone pattern adds durable traction.

The pitch is yours when you lace up in the Vapor 15 Academy IC. It's loaded with a Zoom Air unit and flexible NikeSkin at the top for exceptional touch, so you can dominate in the waning minutes of a match—when it matters most. Fast is in the Air.

Welcome to the pitch, Zoom
For the first time in our history, Nike has developed an all-new Zoom Air unit. It sits in the outsole and provides an additional level of springy underfoot feel that helps you move faster on the pitch and create separation when it matters the most—whether you're scoring goals, being first to the ball or going past defenders.

Drive your speed
The speed cage inside the structure is made from a thin but strong material that secures the foot to the outsole without adding additional weight for optimal lockdown.

Dig in, take off
Based on Nike Sports Research Lab analysis of player movements, the rubber outsole is designed to provide multi-directional traction on street, court and indoor surfaces.

Improved fit
A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better lockdown in the heel.

Feel the ball
The upper has NikeSkin, a soft and flexible mesh material linked together by a thin coating. It helps provide ball control and truly gives you a feeling of barefoot football.

Even Legends find ways to evolve. Made to take your game to the next level, the latest iteration of this Academy boot has all-new FlyTouch Lite engineered leather. Softer than natural leather, it contours to your foot and doesn't overstretch, so you can dictate the pace of your game. Lighter and sleeker than any other Tiempo to date, the Legend 10 is for any position on the pitch, whether you're sending a pinpoint pass through the defence or tracking back to stop a break-away.

Amplified touch
See those micro-dots on the upper? They amplify touch zones for shooting, dribbling and passing. They make for a sleeker look while taking out the extra padding. Better still, they don't sacrifice the ball control you crave on the pitch. We shaved down the foam pods from the Tiempo 9, so your foot can get even closer to the ball when it's in your control. Instead, we moulded the lines into the boot.

Natural, contouring fit
The FlyTouch Lite engineered leather is incredibly soft. It helps the boot mould to your foot for comfort without overstretching the material. Tongue construction with additional padding gives you a secure feel and comfort in key strike zones. Microfibre lining creates a premium feel.

Traction for the pitch
The plate places conical studs in the heel for optimal traction and stability when braking and changing direction—just right under any conditions.

Flyknit wraps your ankle in soft, stretchy fabric for a secure feel. A redone design improves the fit, so that it better simulates the foot. We did this by conducting multiple wear tests on hundreds of athletes. The result is a more contoured toe box and better lockdown in the heel.

Obsessed with perfecting your craft? We design Elite boots for you and the world's biggest stars to give you high-level quality, because you demand greatness from yourself and your footwear. Made from revolutionary Nike Gripknit, this boot provides better touch on the ball in an intuitive design that helps enhance your precision both when striking and during close control.

Enhanced Touch
Nike Gripknit is a sticky material that provides better touch to the ball. It takes up most of the upper, including the first 2 laces, covering the most common strike zones of the foot. It moulds to the shape of your foot and gives you equal grip in wet or dry conditions.

Contoured for Comfort
Asymmetry in the collar and heel provides comfort. Soft elements in the heel make for an easy break-in process and help reduce irritation and pressure without compromising stability and structure.

Traction for the pitch
Tri-star studs work with forefoot flex grooves to provide optimal traction and help unlock change of direction. See the lines on the outsole? They match your typical on-pitch movements, which push forwards then zigzag before a strike.

Even Legends find ways to evolve. The latest iteration of this Elite boot has all-new FlyTouch Plus engineered leather. Softer than natural leather, it contours to your foot and works with All Conditions Control (a grippy texture even in wet weather) so you can dictate the pace of your game. Lighter and sleeker than any other Tiempo to date, the Legend 10 is for any position on the pitch, whether you're sending a pinpoint pass through the defence or tracking back to stop a break-away.

Amplified touch
See those micro-dots on the upper? They amplify touch zones for shooting, dribbling and passing. They make for a sleeker look while taking out the extra padding. Better still, they don't sacrifice the ball control you crave on the pitch. We shaved down the foam pods from the Tiempo 9, so your foot can get even closer to the ball when it's in your control. Instead, we moulded the lines into the boot. All Conditions Control (ACC) technology adds a grippy texture in both wet and dry conditions.

Natural, contouring fit
The FlyTouch Plus engineered leather is incredibly soft. It helps the boot mould to your foot for comfort without overstretching the material. Flyknit around the ankle gives you a secure feel.

Traction for the pitch
The plate places conical studs in the heel for optimal traction and stability when braking and changing direction—just right under any conditions.
